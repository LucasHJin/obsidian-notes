# Object Oriented Programming

**OOP:** Combines data with functions inside 1 object rather than keeping them separate (procedural programming)
- **Class:** Blueprint to create objects
	- Allows the reusable modelling of various real-world entities (assigning them attributes)
	- **Object:** (also called instance of class) specific example based off of a class
		- I.e. if a class is a person, an object would be Micheal Jackson
- You use OOP because:
	- It allows for reusability
	- It allows for improved maintenance (less changes)
	- It allows for abstraction (not focusing on one specific example)

**Modelling:** 
- [[OOP - UML Diagrams]] 

**Methods:** a function that is defined within a class and is associated with instances of that class
- [[OOP - Instance Methods]] 
- [[OOP - Class Methods]] 
- [[OOP - Static Methods]] 
- [[OOP - Magic Methods (Operator Overloading)]] 

**Security within OOP:** 
- [[OOP - Encapsulation]]



[[OOP - Inheritance]]
