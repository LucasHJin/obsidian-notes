# FH.2.4 Vector Borne and Water Borne Diseases

**Vector borne:** When a pathogen jumps from one host to another that isn't accustomed to it (no defenses)
- I.e. malaria (mosquitos transmit, even though they need water)
- **Zoonotic diseases:** Vector borne from animals specifically
- Outbreaks have been increasing in recent years
	- I.e. Used up over half of terrestrial surface 
	- Living nearer animals and farming more of them
		- I.e. west nile virus (not a problem in US until 1990s)
			- Diverse species of birds -> some are good at carrying and some are bad
			- Made it harder for virus to spread among birds
			- But, disrupted these habitats
- **Vector:** living organisms that cna transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans
	- many of these vectors are bloodsucking insects, which ingest disease producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host (human or animal) and later transmit it into a host, after the pathogen has been replicated
**Water borne:** Diseases which spread through dirty water (mainly in poorer countries)
- I.e. e-coli, cholera, diarrhea
- Contaminated water and poor sanitation -> linked to transmission of diseases 
	- Absent, inadequate or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks
	- Problem in LICs -> water is used for many non compatible purposes (i.e. human waste + drinking/cooking)

**Detailed examples:** 
- **Cholera**: 
- **Malaria:**
