# Hess's Law explained

**Hess's Law:** the total enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is independent of the route by which the chemical reaction takes place, as long as the initial and final conditions are the same
- Many different processes to reach the same products
	- **Law of conservation of energy** 
- **Energy cycles:** diagram that shows different paths that can achieve the same products

		- **Direct route enthalpy:** $\Delta H_1$ 
		- **Indirect route enthalpy:** $\Delta H_2+\Delta H_3$ 
			- $\Delta H_{1}=\Delta H_{2}+\Delta H_3$ 
	- *Going against arrow is **Reverse enthalpy change*** 

**Method 1:**
- Can rearrange to get any of the desired enthalpies:
	- $\Delta H_{1}=\Delta H_{2}+\Delta H_3$ 
	- $\Delta H_{2}=\Delta H_{3}-\Delta H_1$ 
	- $\Delta H_{3}=\Delta H_{1}-\Delta H_2$ 

**Method 2:** 
- **Energy cycle diagram method:** 
	- Instead of using chemical equations for the separate pathways, a diagram can be used instead
	- equations provided are for the combustions of each chemical species in the equation that you are solving for
		- Negative value enthalpy if arrow flipped
	- I.e. ![[Screenshot 2024-08-30 at 2.23.50 PM.png|400]]


**Example:** 
- $C_5H_12 + 8O_2 → 5CO_2 + 6H_2O$ 
- **Step 1:** Make equations that create all the original components (doesn't matter if on wrong side)
	- $5C + 6H_2\rightarrow \mathbf{C_5H_{12}}\qquad ΔH = −173 kJ$ 
		- $\mathbf{C_5H_{12}} \rightarrow 5C+6H_{2}\qquad \Delta H=+173kJ$  (reverse equation)
	- $5C + \mathbf{5O_2}\rightarrow \mathbf{5CO_2}\qquad ΔH = −1970 kJ$ 
	- $6H_{2}+ \mathbf{3O_2}\rightarrow \mathbf{6H_2O}\qquad ΔH = −1716 kJ$ 
- **Step 2:** Cancel out the same values -> i.e. $6H_{2}, 5C$ 
- **Step 3:** Left with reaction that you were solving for:
	- $\mathbf{C_5H_12 + 8O_2 → 5CO_2 + 6H_2O}$ 
- **Step 4:** Add up enthalpy to get net enthalpy
	- $ΔH = +173 kJ mol^{−1} + (−1970 kJ mol^{−1}) + (−1716 kJ mol^{−1}) = −3513 kJ mol^{−1}$
