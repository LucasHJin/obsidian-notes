# FH.2.1 The Merits of a Systems Approach

**Inputs:** What you start with initially
- Land, Labour, Materials, Building, etc.
**Processes:** Tasks that need completing for a final product
- Plowing, sowing seeds, harvesting, storing, packaging, etc.
**Outputs:** Final product
- I.e. wheat, corn, potatoes, waste, etc.

**Subsistence farming:** Producing for own family 
- Typically in developing countries
- Low capital input (reliant on labour)
	- Minimal amounts of machinery
- Low output
	- Mix of arable and pastural farming

**Commercial farming:** Producing to sell
- Generally larger scale
- Low labour input (mechanization of tasks) in HICs
	- Higher labour input in LICs
- Very high capital input
	- Highly mechanized, high use of fertilizers, greenhouses, etc.
- High output
	- Specialized range of products

**Key terms:** 
- **Arable:** Cultivation of crops
- **Pastoral:** Rearing of animals
- **Commercial:** Products sold to make a product
- **Subsistence:** Products consumed by the cultivators
- **Intensive:** High inputs or yields per unit area
- **Extensive:** Low inputs or yields per unit area
- **Nomadic:** Farmers moving seasonally with their herds
- **Sedentary:** Farmers remaining in the same place throughout the year

**Factors affecting farming activities:** 
- **Physical** 
	- Climate
		- Precipitation
			- Type, frequency, intensity, amount
		- Temperature
			- Growing season (>6), ground frozen (0), range of temperatures
	- Soil
		- Fertility
			- pH, cation exchange capacity, nutrient status
		- Structure
		- Texture
		- Depth
	- Pests
		- Vermin, locusts, disease, etc.
	- Slope
		- Gradient
	- Relief
		- Altitude
	- Aspect
		- Ubac (shady), Adret (sunny)
- **Human** 
	- Political
		- Land tenure/ownership
			- Ownership, rental, share-cropping, state control
		- Organization
			- Collective, cooperative agribusinesses, family farm
		- Government policies
			- Subsidies, guaranteed prices, ESAs, quotas, set-aside
		- War
			- Disease, famine
	- Economic
		- Farm size
			- Field size and shape
		- Demand
			- Size and type of market
		- Capital
			- Equipment, machinery, seeds, money, **inputs**
		- Technology
			- High-yielding varieties (HYVs), fertilizers, irrigation
		- Infrastructure
			- Roads, communication, storage
		- Advertising
	- Social
		- Cultural and traditional influences
		- Education and training
		- Behavioural influences
		- Chance

**Food miles:** 
- Measures use of fuel and other resources to transport food over long distances
	- Can impact/be impacted by city planning
- Sometimes not always better to buy from closer
	- I.e. climate can limit what food is able to be produced locally
	- GHGs produced by on farm practices, processing, packaging, inputs, etc.
		- Only 4% from transportation of food, 80% from production
		- May actually use GHGs to compensate
			- I.e. supplemental feed for producing lambs
			- Possible to grow avocados in Colorado but better in California
	- Small cars are less efficient
		- So us driving closer can be worse than mass transportation
	- Cows and sheep are much worse (animal consumption causes a large addition to GHGs)
		- Cutting back on meat and dairy much better than reducing transportation
- I.e. "The further your food travels the great the impact on the environment. Discuss this statement."

**Physical systems:** Paddies -> feed a lot of people, a lot of nutrients
- But also need a lot of people to produce and allows for many natural disasters
	- I.e Desa Kota
	- Information technology
