# LC - Container With Most Water

**Preliminary notes:** 
- Use 2 pointers on opposite ends
	- The lower height = the height of the water
	- Maybe only move the lower one?
	- If they are both equal → can move them both inwards
		- Because guarenteed if one is higher, then it will still get capped and if one is lower then its less
		- So move them both inwards

**Finished notes:**
