# LC - Contains Duplicate

**Preliminary notes:** 
- Use a hashmap with one pass through → as soon as it becomes larger than 1, break and return true
	- Else return false at the end

**Finished notes:** 
- Should have used a hash set instead
	- Only care about existence (not about mapping keys to pairs)
