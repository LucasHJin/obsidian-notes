# Intervals explained

**Interval problems:** problems where eat item represents a range with a start + end
- I.e. a timeslot

**Core steps:** 
1. Sort the interval by start time
	1. This makes it easier to detect overlap
	2. Compare only neighbors
2. Process intervals (prev + current)
	1. Check if they merge / overlap / conflict
