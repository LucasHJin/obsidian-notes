# LC - Binary Search

**Preliminary notes:** 
- Just the typical while loop implementation of [[Binary search explained|binary search]] 
	- Use two pointers, find middle, validate and continue
- Could also do it with recursion
	- But this takes more space → O(logn) (because that’s the max amount of possible recursive calls)

**Finished notes:**
