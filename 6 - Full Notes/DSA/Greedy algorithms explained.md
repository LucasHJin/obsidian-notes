# Greedy algorithms explained

**Greedy algorithm:** making a greedy/definitive choice at every step in the algorithm
- *Note* → heaps + sorting comes up a lot

**Properties:** 
- *Greedy choice property* → a global optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at each step
- *Optimal substructure* → occurs when an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solution to the subproblems
	- I.e. every choice is a subproblem
