# LC - Valid Palindrome

**Preliminary notes:** 
- Use a [[Two pointers explained|two pointer]] method where it goes from opposite directions (2 ends)
	- Move one towards other if its an invalid character or both if they are same

**Finished notes:** 
- Just as described → note that you need to continue to next iteration to make sure pointers are still valid
