# LC - Invert Binary Tree

**Preliminary notes:** 
- Use recursion
	- Reconstruct a new tree from ground up?
- Go into the tree and swap left and right subtrees recursively?

**Finished notes:** 
- Solution outlined in preliminary
	- Just make a new tree node where you recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees
