# Bucket sort explained

Sorting algorithm that distributes elements of an array into a number of buckets (containers), sorts each bucket individually (using another sorting algorithm or recursively applying bucket sort), and then concatenates the buckets to get the final sorted result
- Useful for uniformly distributed data
- Basically divide it into smaller containers, sort those smaller containers and when you combine its already sorted based on the initial division
