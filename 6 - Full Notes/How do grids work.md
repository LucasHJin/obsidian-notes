# How do grids work

**What?**
- 2D array (table with rows and columns)
- Has values associated with either obstacles or weights

**Examples:**
- Pathfinding (e.g., finding the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right).
- Connected components (e.g., finding all distinct regions or islands in a grid).
- Dynamic programming on grids (e.g., minimum path sum).

**If not weighted:**
- Paths/traversal
	- [[BFS explained|BFS]]
	- [[DFS explained|DFS]]
- Calculating something
	- [[Dynamic programming explained|Dynamic Programming]]

**If weighted:**
- Paths/traversal
	- [[Dijkstra's algorithm explained|Dijkstra]]
	- [[A* explained|A*]]
- Calculating something
