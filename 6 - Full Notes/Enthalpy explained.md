# Enthalpy explained

**Enthalpy (H):** the amount of heat that a system has (kJ/mol)
- You normally measure changes in enthalpy **(∆H)** 
- Exothermic (release) -> negative **∆H**
	- **![200](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfa4Nc5IE4ddp1Az5AI9eWLdkSFFYGuxEn656ms5QGX94AbfYprU8gfPkQmBhm9xDcSRJrFESabLwGUd3LaYe-8kfELD6D24U85f7-Tw9sKaUnoqCVEcGmkQGd7VkeDwGUcnGtyVX_tSeL9PznmVa9Lcd6_?key=uonqjEa8sicrvGR17vyIcA) 
- Endothermic (absorb) -> positive **∆H**
- **Standard enthalpy change of reaction (∆H°)**: heat transferred at constant pressure, under standard conditions and states
	- **Thermochemical equation:** Equation with the enthalpy change

- **Bond Enthalpy ($H$) / Bond Dissociation Energy (E):** 
	- the energy required to break one mole of chemical bonds in the gaseous state (always positive) (kJ/mol)
	- Normally an average
		- Changes depending on the molecule and branch (not one guarenteed value)
	- **==∆H = Σ(BE of broken bonds) - Σ(BE of formed bonds)==** 
	- **==∆H = Σ(reactant BE) - Σ(product BE)==**
	- **Example:** $H_2+F_2=2HF$ 
		- $H-H=436$ 
		- $F-F=159$ 
		- $2HF=2\cdot 567$ 
			- $∆H = (436+159) - (2*567) = -539$ 
- **Net Enthalpy (H):** The total enthalpy of a chemical equation (regardless of how it was achieved/which path was taken) 
	- Can be achieved with [[Hess's Law explained]] 


**Thermal energy (Q) vs Enthalpy (H) vs Heat (q) vs Temperature (T):** 
- **Thermal Energy** is the total kinetic energy of particles in a substance due to their motion.
- **Enthalpy** is the total heat content of a system at constant pressure, including internal energy and work done by the system.
- **Heat** is the transfer of thermal energy between systems due to a temperature difference.
- **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance and determines the direction of heat flow.
