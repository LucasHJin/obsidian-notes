# Global Issue Statements explained

**Criteria for GIS:**
- Must be ==transnational== 
- Must have a ==local impact== 
- Needs to be ==significant== 

**Formulas:** 
1. Relationship between A and B 
	1. Both are equal -> can have impact on each other
2. Impact of A on B 
	1. A is the stronger thing -> impact of A on B

 ^^Mix and match SDGs with IB Fields of inquiry (GI) (choose specific things from a specific IBFOI)
- BUT DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY SITUATE UNDER 1 FIELD OF INQUIRY
- For SDG: Be more specific, use descriptors
	- Access to, inefficient, insufficient

**Example:**
- **Good**
	- Relationship between transnational identity and gender.
- **Bad**
	- Healthcare in the USA should be free (not 1).

**==STAY AWAY FROM THE WORD 'IDENTITY' ON IT'S OWN (SPECIFIY)==**
