# Energy profile diagrams and Molecularity

**Multi-step reactions with EP:** 
- Example: $A_2+2BC\rightarrow B_2+2AC$ 
	- $(1)\text{ } A_2+2BC\rightarrow AB+AC$ 
	- $(2)\text{ } AB+BC\rightarrow B_2+2AC$ 
	- EP diagram:
		-  ![[Screenshot 2024-10-26 at 2.46.20 PM.png|300]] 
			- 2 peaks -> means it's a 2 step reaction with 2 **transition** states (1 per elementary step)
			- 1 dip -> **intermediate** step
			- 1st step energy > 2nd step energy -> First step is [[Reaction Mechanisms Chemistry|**rate-determining**]] step (slower)
				- Energy is based on total difference between lowest and highest point, not just highest point
- **Note:** Overall activation energy of the entire reaction (minimum energy for the reaction to proceed) is equal to the energy to take the **reactants** to the transition state with the **highest energy**

		- Even though $E_{a2}$ is the rate determining step, the needed activation energy is the yellow $E_a$
