# R2.2 How fast? The rate of chemical change

**Rate of Reaction (RoR):** measured quantity for the rate at which a reaction is occurring (determined from change in concentration)
- Faster rate = faster reaction occurrences
- Reactant concentration ↓, Product concentration ↑
- **Formulas:** 
	- $\text{rate}=\frac{\Delta[P]}{\Delta t}$ Products
	- $\text{rate}=\frac{\Delta[R]}{\Delta t}$ Reactants
	- **Units:**
		- $\frac{mol}{dm^{3}\cdot s}$ 
	- [[Rate Expression and Experimental Determination]] 
		- For finding the effect of change in concentration of various reactants on the rate of reaction
- [[Factors affecting Rates of Reaction]]
- [[Measuring Rates of Reaction - Techniques]] 

**Collision theory:** 
- For reactions to happen:
	- The particles must collide with a minimum amount of energy 
		- **Activation energy $(E_A)$:** The minimum amount of kinetic energy needed by the particles for successful collisions to occur.
	- The collisions must have the correct collision geometry

**Visualization:** 
- [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves]] 
- [[Energy profile diagrams and Molecularity]] 

**How reactions work:** Follow specific steps
- [[Reaction Mechanisms Chemistry]]
	- Affects the rate of the entire reaction based off of the slowest step
	- [[Orders of Reaction Chemistry]] 
	- [[Orders of Reaction and Reaction Mechanisms]] 
- [[Molecularity explained]]

**Arrhenius equation:** Used to find the value of $k$ (the rate constant) 
- Important because RoR depends on $k$ and concentration of reactants raised to a power ($[A]^n[B]^m$)
