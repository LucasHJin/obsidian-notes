# Statistics To Know

**Sampling techniques:** 
- Random, convenience, systematic, quote, stratified

**Histograms/Frequency Diagrams:** 
- Histogram -> continuous data
- Frequency diagram -> frequency of each set of data
	- Can read and understand both
- Cumulative frequency diagrams/cumulative frequency graph
	- Adding them up
	- Median, quartiles, percentiles, range, IQR

**Box plots:** 
- Box plots + whisker diagrams
	- Compare 2 distributions, use symmetry, median

**Simple Single Variable Statistics** 
- Mean, median and mode + relationships (measures of central tendency)
- Measures of dispersion (IQR, standard deviation, variance)
	- Can calculate with data (SD)
- Calculate effects of constant changes on data for mean and SD

**Correlation and Bivariate Statistics:** 
- Lines of best fit (pass through mean point)
- Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (GDC)
	- Only for linear
- __ correlation

**Regression:** 
- Use regression line for prediction
	- Parameters a, b for $y=ax+b$ 
- Can't always make a prediction of $x$ from $y$ when using $y$ on $x$ line

**Connections with probability** 
- Calculate mean/variance of binomial distribution
- Calculate and interpret standardization of normal variables (z-values)
	- Use to calculate unknown means/SD
