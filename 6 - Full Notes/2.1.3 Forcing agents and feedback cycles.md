# 2.1.3 Forcing agents and feedback cycles

Linked to [[2.1.2 Global energy balance]] 

**Forcing agents/Climate forcings:** factors that affect the balance of energy in the Earth's climate system
- **Global dimming:** a decrease of insolation reaching the Earth’s surface
	- **Solar radiation**  
		- Tiny particles/aerosols are surrounded with water (with high albedo) in the atmosphere -> reflects solar radiation
			- Causes a cooling of the Earth’s surface 
			- Reduction of evaporation that leads to a reduction of precipitation
	- **Volcanic eruptions** 
		- Produces $CO_2$, ash particles and sulfur rich gases
			- Sulphuric gas -> becomes sulphuric aerosol (stays 3-4 years in stratosphere reflecting sunlight)

**Feedback loops/cycles:** loops/systems that keep a system in dynamic equilibrium (never tilting to one extreme)
- **Negative feedback loop:** Dampens change by reducing inputs + moves towards stability (equilibrium)
	- I.e. Less rabbits -> more grass -> more rabbits -> less grass -> repeat
- **Positive feedback loop:** Increases/amplifies change + moves away from stability (always moving away)
	- Ice melts -> more sun is absorbed and water is hotter -> more ice melts
	- **Less common**

**Methane gas & Feedback Loops:** 
- **Methane**: GHG that is much more dangerous for GW than $CO_2$ 
	- Short lifespan but extremely effective
	- Can come from natural sources (i.e. permafrost)
		- When permafrost is melted -> releases methane -> heats up the planet more -> melts the permafrost more -> releases more methane -> etc.
	- Can also come from human sources
		- I.e. cattle industry, rice paddies

**Feedback loops example:** 
- Global temperature -> more evaporation -> higher altitude and low albedo cloud formation -> more absorption of energy by Earth and repeat
	- Positive feedback loop to warm up Earth
- Global temperature -> more evaporation -> lower altitude higher albedo cloud formation -> less absorption of solar energy by Earth and repeat
