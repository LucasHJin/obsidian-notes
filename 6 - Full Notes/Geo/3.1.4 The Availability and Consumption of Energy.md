# 3.1.4 The Availability and Consumption of Energy

**Energy:** including the relative and changing importance of hydrocarbons, nuclear power renewables, new sources of modern energy
- By 2040 -> need 217 million GW more than right now
- Not just growing population
	- More people are using more energy (i.e. growing middle class/lowering poverty)
	- More digitized societies
	- More transportation
- Where does the energy come from:
	- 80% - fossil fuels
	- 20% - alternatives (i.e. wind, hydro, solar, nuclear)
		- Renewable will only account for 40% of total energy generation by 2040

**Nuclear Energy:** Energy resulting from nuclear reactors/power plants
- Dramatic increase during the 80s and 90s, but recent decrease (i.e. Japan, Germany)
- **Advantages:** 
	- Low carbon + emission
	- Readily available
	- Very powerful + efficient
- **Disadvantages:** 
	- Radioactive waste is dangerous/unstable + remains for a long time
	- Impossible to be 100% reliability (i.e. Chernobyl)
		- Possible to be terrorist attractions
	- Energy source = uranium = scarce/nonrenewable
	- Takes long time to build

**Nonrenewable Energy:** Energy that runs out or can't replenish itself fast enough
- I.e. fossil fuels (such as coal, gas and oil)
	- Main economies of HICs were built off of them
- **Advantages:** 
	- Cheap and plentiful
	- Advanced technology for safe extraction and usage
	- Generate most energy by far
	- Transportable
- **Disadvantages:** 
	- Contribution to climate change (build up of CO2)
	- Unsustainability
		- Finite resources that take an exceptionally long time to renew

**Renewable Energy:** Energy that either renews itself at a fast enough rate or never runs out
- I.e. a low-carbon, low-emission, non-renewable resource
- **Advantages:** 
	- No pollutants released (i.e. GHGs or chemicals)
	- Don't run out (reusable forever)
- **Disadvantages:** 
	- Much more expensive than fossil fuels
	- Inertia within cultures (nonrenewable are much more favoured)
	- Location of renewable sites often determined by politics (i.e. nobody wants to be near wind turbines)
- **Examples:** 
	- **Hydroelectric:** Using dams to power turbines that can be switched on and off
		- Reliable and cheap but may also cause loss of farmland or habitats
	- **Tidal:** Using ebbing and flowing of sea level to power turbines
		- Needs good tidal range and coastline right shape but is expensive plus may interfere with wildlife
	- **Solar:** Using solar panels with solar cells (passive solar energy)
		- Much cheaper but is not very effective during the winter season, etc.
	- **Wind:** Using wind turbines and electromagnetic electricity
		- Limited by lack of wind (need good placement)
	- **Biofuel:** Burning plant material to give off heat (transform into ethanol)
		- Great potential for circular economy
		- Produce emissions and require a lot of land
	- **Waste:** When organic waste decomposes, it produces methane (can be burned)
		- Readily available, does not deplete natural resource, makes use of waste
		- Adds to GHGs (but technically would do this either way)
- **Green energy:** Subset of renewable energy that can be renewed naturally and has the least impact on the environment
- **Note:** Clean energy is not necessarily renewable
	- **Clean energy:** Energy that is created without emitting greenhouse gasses but isn't necessarily renewable naturally.
		- I.e. Nuclear
