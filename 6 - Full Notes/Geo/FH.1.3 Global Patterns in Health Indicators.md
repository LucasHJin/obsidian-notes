# FH.1.3 Global Patterns in Health Indicators

**Indicators:** 
- HALE
- Infant Mortailty
- Maternal Mortality
- Access to Sanitation
- People per Doctor/Physician 
- **[NOTES FOR INDICATORS**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNG7BY-nCnrnkD-ZFDKC2n14fgtbJlYtS5lOkBrmqEo/edit?usp=sharing) 

**Epidemiological transition:** change from communicable (infective) disease to non-communicable disease
- 3 Phases of transition:
	- **Pestilence and famine:** Pre-history to 1750 
		- Infectious disease
		- War and famine
		- No access to education
	- **Receding pandemics:** 1750 to 1950
		- More nutrition, sanitation, medical care
	- **Degenerative disease:** 1950 to present
		- Increase in life expectancy -> increase in diseases in elderly
		- Sedentary life style -> obesity
			- NCD -> kill 49 million every year (70%)
			- Majority in LMICs
		- Taking place very quickly and at a time with social differences
			- Double burden of disease -> chronic disease and primitive infective disease
		- I.e. in NCDs:
			- Patients require **ongoing** treatment
			- Prevention requires **lifestyle** changes
			- Needs **multidisciplinary teams**
			- Need self control and education
- Future:
	- Reemergence of infective diseases
		- New infectious diseases that have evolved new resistance strategies to diseases
			- I.e. to HIV, Malaria, etc.
		- Increase in Zoonotic infections
			- jumping from animal hosts to humans and then spreading over borders
				- More and more will appear as more humans appear and move around
