# 3.2.2 Nexus Thinking and WEF Security

**Water security:** the availability and reliable access to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as for access to sufficient quantities of water for agricultural and manufacturing 
- Highest insecurity in Africa and parts of Middle East
	- Insecurity is not same in different areas
	- I.e. not available vs all used up vs used in other sectors
- Many countries/planners -> most neglected part of nexus is water
	- I.e. in China, groundwater is being used up
- **Note:** water differs from energy or food because its amount can't be changed, only exchanged between places
	- Can't be substituted with something else either

**Energy security:** the availability and reliable access to sufficient clean and affordable energy to meet essential needs (i.e. lighting, cooking, heating, manufacturing, communications)
- Highest insecurity in Africa
- Idea of vulnerability
	- 3 persistent types of concerns
		1. Who controls energy (imports or domestic)
		2. How long will the energy last (is the infrastructure ready for these threats)
		3. When we face a disruption, how fast we can face it and recover (resiliency)

**Food security:** the availability and reliable access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet the dietary needs and food preferences of the population to lead an active and healthy life
- Highest insecurity in Africa
- **Possible solution:**
	- **Vertical farming:** growing crops indoors, on stacked layers
		- **Benefits:**
			- Saves space + innovative infrastructure
				- There is not much land left for farming
			- Less use of pesticides
			- Increased food security
		- **Negative:**
			- Higher energy
			- Limited in what food can be grown
				- Not very efficient -> i.e. cereals are tall and can't grow many upwards
			- Currently has higher carbon footprint than regular farming
				- Is it really better to decarbonize this sector instead of others

^Demand all going up because more people + demand (middle class)

**Nexus thinking techniques:** 
- Use renewable sources of energy and generate energy from waste
- Reduce food waste
- Replace traditional spray agriculture with drip irrigation
- Improve supply chains
- Improve crop productivity and yields
- Reduce the need for water in manufacturing by recycling + new tech
- Encourage crop farming techniques that don't disturb the soil

**Need to:** 
- Assess and understand the risks
- Engage decision makers/those with power
- Enable action

**Climate change and Nexus Thinking:** 
- May reduce/increase agricultural productivity (same for water supplies + demand for energy)
	- Influences crop availability, water availability, need for irrigation, distribution of pests, etc.
	- Higher temperature and evapotranspiration
	- More competition between food and energy for limited water
- Also affected by attempts to limit CC
	- I.e. need water for biofuels and hydroelectric fuel
- Will have greatest initial impact on water sector
