# 2.3.3 Strategies to respond to GCC

**Mitigation:** efforts aimed at reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and enhancing the sinks that absorb these gases
**Adaptation:** efforts made to adjust to the actual or expected impacts of climate change
- measures to minimize the negative effects of climate change on people, infrastructure, and ecosystems

____
**Penalizing laws:** Penalize for going over a certain limit

**Carbon tax:** Price on carbon emissions
- Charge companies for increased carbon -> increases prices for customers and encourages the use of carbon free products

**Carbon trading:** (cap and trade)
- Higher carbon footprint areas paying smaller carbon footprint places for their carbon footprint to increase limit
	- If goes above cap -> needs permit
		- Can buy/trade for more carbon permit
- Fixed amount of allowance for each country/company
	- Either cut emissions or buy extra emissions
	- Keep emissions or sell them
		- Ensures that emissions are cut where it costs the least to do so
	- Over time:
		- Cap is reduced + less emissions are issued
	- ==EU emission's trading system== 
- Problem:
	- Not enough cost on carbon to encourage carbon reduction
	- Even if carbon is priced properly, fines are still low
	- Firms can evade detection
		- I.e. can relocate to somewhere where rules are more lax (can be fixed with import tax)

**Carbon offset:** 
- Invest in carbon credits (positive impact projects) so that there is extra carbon that can be burned elsewhere
	- I.e. Use nature to compensate for emissions that can't be eliminated
	- I.e. investing money to plant trees

**Geoengineering:** manipulating the Earth’s environmental systems to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic climate change
- Compliment strategies of GHG mitigation
	- Does not address root cause
- Examples:
	- Fertilizing water with iron
	- Stratospheric aerosol injection
		- Blocks out the sun and UV rays 
		- This is so that CO2 can't trap IR radiation on Earth
		- Happens naturally
			- I.e. 29% of solar radiation is reflected by high albedo
			- Volcanoes -> Strong impact on global climate
				- Many tonnes of particles and gas (including sulfure dioxide)
				- Produced a haze of SO2 droplets to create veils
				- Reduce sunlight reaching by 1%, dropped by 0.5C globally
		- How:
			- Cheap and doable
			- Small fleet of planes, once a year, at equator
			- 5-8 M tonnes
		- Possible negatives
			- Rainfall patterns could change and cause famine
			- Stratosphere is heated (bad for ozone layer)
				- Could break the ozone layer
				- Need more research for different particles
			- Might be an excuse to switch to carbon-free economy
			- Oceans are becoming acidic by absorbing CO2
			- Forced to keep pumping the environment 
				- If stopped -> will heat up much quicker (like a time bomb)
		- Best case scenario:
			- Use it for a decade or two to transition to a green society without just using it as an excuse
