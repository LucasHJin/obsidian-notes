# Geography - Map Projections

Need to decide how to distort the map because sphere ≠ rectangle
- I.e. Mercator map
	- Constant straight direction (by special stretching)
	- I.e. google maps
	- But also makes size of places look different than actual
- Lambert's cylindrical projection
	- Sizes are right but direction are bad (biggest distortion at poles)
- Winkel triple projection
	- Averaged out Aitoff projection and Equirectangular projection
- Can be non-eurocentric
	- I.e. asia-centric
