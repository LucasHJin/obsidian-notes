# 3.3.1 Divergent thinking about population and resource consumption

**Pessimistic views:** Malthus/neo-Malthusians, Paul Ehrlich/Club of Rome's *The Limits to Growth* 
**Optimistic views:** Anti-Malthusians, Boserup/Simon
**Balanced views:** Resources stewardship/Carrying Capacity

**Malthus theory:** 
1. Food is necessary for life
2. We multiply due to our passion
- Lived at the beginning of the cultural revolution (massive population boom from increased birth rate and decreased death rate)
	- Malthus thought this was negative
		- Observed that population was growing geometrically but food supply was growing arithmetically
			- Would run out of food eventually
			- Causing conflict and reduce population manageable level and then it would occur all over again
			- Encouraged lower birth rate
	- BUT:
		- New technologies allowed food rates to keep up with population
	- **Neo-Malthusians** - Paul Ehrlich
		- Argued that limited resources keep populations in check and reduce economic growth (so we should limit population to avoid stressing resources)
			- Concerns itself with multiple resources (WEF) unlike Malthus
	- Critique:
		- Rate of food production is proportional to population growth naturally
- **Club of Rome:** Group which argued that population growth and finite natural resources would create mass misery
	- Modelled with computer simulations
- **Failures of pessimistic models:** 
	- Not accounting for technical innovations
	- Not allowing trade from sufficient to deficient areas
	- Over simplistic/over estimating population growth

**Anti-Malthusians:** 
- Argues that more people means more food because people are productive resources (have capacity to produce, not just consume)
	- , causing food production to rise faster than population growth (**agricultural intensification**)
	- Evidence:
		- You can measure scarcity with price (more expensive = more scarce) -> everything is going down in price
- I.e. Julian Simon, Ester Boserup
	- **Example**: wanted ivory for billiard balls, made a cheaper plastic when materials ran low
- Predicts endless surpassing of population growth by food production

**Balanced views:** 
- **Resource stewardship:** ethical principle that views managing resources as a responsibility undertaken as a privilege on behalf of others
	- (Resources are managed with entire global community and future taken into account) -> prevents irresponsible use of limited resources
		- Encourages sustainability and responsibleness (not for profit)
		- Make decision based on holistic data and evidence
- **Systems thinking:** holistic approach to problem-solving and analysis that focuses on understanding the interconnectedness and relationships within a system rather than examining individual components in isolation (bigger picture)
	- Replaced RS in the 2010s
		- Considers 2-way interactions and all elements of the system (i.e. inputs, outputs, processes, feedback loops, interactions, etc.)
	- Enables resource management goals to become a network of targets (if one is achieved, others are positively affected)
		- Contrasts **event-oriented thinking** (it is non-linear -> understands that consequences can be delayed or counterintuitive)

**How to increase food:** 
- Vertical farming
- Agricultural techniques that improve soil health
- Renewable energy sources
	- Lower supply costs + more efficient
- Better fertilizers
- Better technology
