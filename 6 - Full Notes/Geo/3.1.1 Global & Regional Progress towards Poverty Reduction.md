# 3.1.1 Global & Regional Progress towards Poverty Reduction

**Note:** The way in which a country develops is a *process* (4 P's)
- Can be modelled with **Rostow's stages of economic development** 
	- Traditional Society
		- Economy is subsistent, majority of population is in primary sector
		- Slow economic growth, little specialization, no technology
	- Preconditions for Takeoff
		- Economy grows (investment in education + infrastructure)
		- New industries emerge (secondary sector) -> more foreign states become interested
	- Takeoff Stage
		- Rapid economic growth -> transition out of agriculture to industrial activity
		- More jobs and opportunities open for secondary sector
		- More technology, may get exploited by foreign states
	- Drive to Maturity
		- Starts to specialize + participate in global trade
		- More opportunities in tertiary sector + high economic growth
		- Influence from foreign states but less reliant
	- High Mass Consumption
		- Economy is fully developed -> products meet needs and wants
			- Consumer culture
		- Majority tertiary sector + independent from foreign states
	- **Critiques:** 
		- Does not account for external factors (i.e. environmental conditions, colonialism, etc.)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241112085512.png|500]] 


**Poverty:** the state of being extremely poor, lacking material possessions or money
- Relative depending on what is considered a necessary quality of life (comparing to others) -> need explicit value (PL)
- **Who?**
	- 60% of poorest in 5 countries:
		- India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh, DR of Conga
	- Much higher in LICs
		- Concentrated in SS Africa and S. Asia
	- More likely to affect women
		- I.e. rose in Latin America for women (not lowered)
- **Reasons for poverty decline:** 
	- Globalization (increased trade, more work, etc.)
	- Government policies:
		- Improved health
		- More access to education
		- Better infrastructure
	- Increased use of appropriate technology (better machinery)
	- 

**Poverty line/threshold:** used to define minimum level of income required to secure the necessities of life (varies by country)
- I.e. $32.25/day USA vs $0.40/day India
- (International) **Extreme poverty:** $2.15/person 
	- Set as the typical national poverty line in the world’s poorest countries.

**Middle class:** a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy
- **Narrowest definition:** middle fifth of the nation's income ladder
- **Widest definition:** everyone but the poorest 20% and the wealthiest 20%.
- **Global middle class:** Majority of world will become middle class
	- Tremendous expansion of economic capacity to meet middle class needs
	- Especially in emerging economies
		- Creates [[3.1.2 Measuring Trends in Resource Consumption - Ecological Footprint|higher carbon emissions per person]] 
			- Different lifestyles (i.e. more meat diets, more travelling, more imports/exports, etc.)
	- Smaller global population -> family sizes shrink as middle class progresses (fewer children + better educated)
