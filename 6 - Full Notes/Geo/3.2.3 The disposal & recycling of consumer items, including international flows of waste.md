# 3.2.3 The disposal & recycling of consumer items, including international flows of waste

**Solid Domestic Waste:** waste generated by households and small-scale commercial establishments (waste generated from/containing everyday items)

**Methods of disposal (worst to best):**
- Return
	- Return to environment
- Recover
	- Capture some value
- Recycle
	- Use in different flow
- Reuse
	- Reintroduce in same flow
- Re-source
	- Change materials/sources
- Reduce
	- Use less resources to meet the need
- Remove
	- Eliminate demand altogether

**Note:** You can't use the same strategy for every place
- I.e. Stockholm -> incineration (but you can't use it in India because there isn't enough waste to make it worth it and much of the waste is hard to be incinerated (i.e. it's wet/food scraps))
	- Also it's expensive and produces a lot of CO2 -> needs a lot of waste to be worth it

**E-waste:** Demonstrates idea of circularity
- Squeezing out the worth of all resources (i.e. technology has expensive/important materials like gold)
- **EEE:** Refers to all products with circuitry or electrical components and a power or battery supply
	- From products used by households to businesses
	- I.e. electrical appliances (refrigerators) and electronic devices (phones)
- Each have its own unique material content -> form of disposal is different and may cause unequal harm to the environment and human health if not managed properly
- **Designed for the dump:** Making products designed for being thrown out soon to keep consumers buying
	- **Planned obsolescence:** Another name for the above (products intentionally being outshined by others very soon so people constantly buy new times)
- **Right to repair:** Opposite of above -> right to be able to repair bought items instead of having to buy a new one
- Can be shipped overseas
	- But also can be in HICs: (might go overseas but also stay in the land)
		- Only 17% of EEE are recycled (not designed to be) because it requires a lot of work to separate all the pieces 
		- Recycle is last 
			- Can reuse first and resell if possible
			- I.e. phones
				- But also need security -> i.e. computer hard drives (needs to be wiped to avoid sensitive info leaking)
			- Can separate all parts to be reused and resold 
	- **Negatives:** 
		- Costs a lot for the upkeep + ewaste is only increasing
	- **How to make it better:** 
		- Change manufacturers mindsets (not churn and burn mentality)
		- I.e. create electronics meant to be recycled (i.e. no toxins)

**Landfills:** Using land to dispose of waste
- **Benefits:** 
	- Simple and cheap
- **Negatives:** 
	- Uses up land
	- Smelly/unsightly
	- Not good for the environment
	- May attract rodents/infestations
