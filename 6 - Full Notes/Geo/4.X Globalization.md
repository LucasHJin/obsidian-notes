# 4.X Globalization

**Globalization:** interconnectedness of international world (movement of people, ideas, money, goods, data, GHGs, etc.)
- Good and bad
	- I.e. goods are produced cheaper, easier communication, etc.
	- But also automation of manufacturing -> reduced job numbers
- Governments can:
	- Limit regulations
	- International management as groups (i.e. UN)
- May be threat to culture/identity
