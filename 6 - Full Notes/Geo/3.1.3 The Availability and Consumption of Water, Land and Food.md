# 3.1.3 The Availability and Consumption of Water, Land and Food

**Water -** including embedded water in food and manufactured good
- **Sources**:
	- 68.1% in the form of ice
	- 30.1% is **ground water**: water found in aquifers, the layers of permeable rock up to 600 m below the Earth's surface
	- 1.2% is **surface water**: streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs
		- Most liquid fresh water is underground
	- Third source - **desalination of saline water** (i.e. Saudi Arabia)
	- **Renewable vs Nonrenewable** 
		- **Renewable:** the amount of water that can be drawn from rivers and groundwater without exceeding the rate of replacement from precipitation and melt water
		- **Nonrenewable:** water is taken from deep (fossil) aquifers that are no longer recharged through precipitation, extraction rates exceeding recharge rates, polluted water bodies
	- **Patterns**
		- **Physical Water Scarcity:** a lack of water supply from the natural sources: groundwater and surface water (e.g. deserts).
			- Latitudinal pattern (lack of water in tropical deserts)
			- Tropics are more desertified
			- Equatorial has water (rainforests)
				- Because of circulatory patterns
		- **Economic Water Scarcity:** a lack of investment in water infrastructure such as pipes and water treatment plants (e.g. many LICs).
			- Severe in LICs (SS Africa, SAsian, SAmerica)
			- I.e. big businesses use up the water (nothing left for farmers)
		- **Good conditions:**
			- precipitation levels are moderate to high
			- evaporation levels moderate to low
			- annual precipitation distribution delivers more rainfall/snow in the cooler months.
- **Consumption:** 
	- Domestic (municipal) - 11%
		- Each person uses 300L/day
		- All home uses (i.e. washing, cooking, cleaning, etc.)
	- Industry - 19%
		- 90% of all electricity generation is water intensive (cooling, manufacturing, etc.)
	- Agriculture - 70% (i.e. farming)
		- **Blue water:** All surface water (rivers, lakes, groundwater) 
			- Used for irrigation when droughts occur
		- **Green water:** Water that is stored from rain in the soil
			- I.e. in vegetation, earth, etc.
		- **Grey water:** Discharge from an activity (i.e. laundry) -> water that is used
			- I.e. wastewater produced by agricultural, manufacturing, household and service activities
				- No fecal contaminant
			- Can be reused
		- **Black water:** Water that is too dirty to be used for anything
			- Needs to be cleaned before reuse
	- **Patterns:** 
		- Global mean for agricultural consumption (69%)
			- Lower in HICs, Higher in LICs
			- Largest in Asia and Africa
		- Industrial consumption:
			- Higher in HICs, Lower in LICs
			- Largest in NA and Europe
		- Domestic consumption:
			- Mostly constant (slightly higher in HICs)
		- Lower consumption = areas of economic water scarcity
		- Global water withdrawal has increased over time
			- Increased population
			- Higher living standards
			- Dietary changes
			- Industrialization + Urbanization
		- Reasons for less water usage:
			- Smaller population 
			- Less developed
	- **Embedded water:** the (hidden) water that is used to produce the products we use
		- Allows outsourcing of water intensive tasks to areas with larger water resources
		- I.e. 200 L of water to produce 1 glass of milk
		- Highest in meat, animal based products and chocolate
		- Included in clothing as well, etc.
- **Connection to AI** 
	- Need a lot of energy to power supercomputers
	- Can't use saltwater
		- Needs to be fresh (treated) water that is very cold

**Land/Food -** including changing diets in middle-income countries
- **Production:** 
	- As the population increases and lifestyles change -> need more food
		- Either through more land or more intensive farming techniques -> leads to less space per capita and degradation
	- For LICs in specific
		- Higher pressure because rapid population growth and no financial means to import food (need to produce)
		- Leads to more intensive farming:
			- Higher use of fertilizer and pesticides (pollution of land/ecosystems)
			- Irrigation -> soil salinization
			- High crop production -> soil nutrient deficiency, degradation, erosion
			- GMOs/High yield crops
	- **Patterns** 
		- More land is devoted to farming near the equator (less as latitudinal shift towards the poles)
			- More land overall
		- Better spatial integration
			- More food can get to markets for cheaper
	- **Trends** 
		- LICs devote the most land, then NICs then HICs (HICs' land is declining amount)
			- But HICs have largest sloped trendline upwards (LICs smallest)
			- Because of technology, investment, etc.
- **Consumption:** 
	- Measured by a unit of energy (kilocalorie or kilojoule)
		- Provides both energy and nutrients
	- Amount needed depends on:
		- Age (need more when growing)
		- Gender (women need less)
		- Activity level (affected by job -> i.e. primary industry = more needed)
		- Climate (colder climate = more energy needed)
	- **Patterns** 
		- The world *technically* produces enough food for everyone
			- Most HICs (and Asians and S. Americans) consume excess calories
			- Majority who lack sufficient calories = Sub Saharan Africans
				- Because of poverty, poor infrastructure, extreme weather, war, food waste (33% per year)
	- **Trends** 
		- Since 1980, every region has had an increase in consumption
			- Subsaharan Africa fell behind since 1970s (population growth > infrastructure/agricultural developments)
		- Dietary patterns are changing
			- Dietary homogenization - everybody's diets are converging on one diet (everyone eats same food crop) -> makes more vulnerable (if crop is destroyed)
				- Increase of variety of foods and foods out of season (more imports -> **increased food miles**) 
				- More demand for organic food
				- Significant increase in meat demand
					- Improve protein intake, social sign of wealth
					- Increased GHG
				- *Most clearly noticed as LICs -> NICs* 
		- Demand is inelastic
			- At a certain point, food consumption stops eve with higher economic standing
		- Increased urbanization
			- Mass produced products + fast food
		-
