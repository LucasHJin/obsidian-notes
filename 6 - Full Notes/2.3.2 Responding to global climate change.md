# 2.3.2 Responding to global climate change

**Government-led adaptation and mitigation strategies for global climate change** 

**COP:** 
- **The world's first earth summit**
	- Brazil 1992 -> Rio for first ever Earth summit
		- UN called conference to talk about environment
		- Engage developing countries
	- 3 agreements
- **IPCC**
	- Intergovernmental panel of climate change
		- Get world's scientists together to advise policy makers on climate change
			- Best assessment every few years
- **UNFCCC**
	- United nations framework conventions on climate change
		- Use to cope
- **COP - purpose**
	- Conference of the Parties
		- Each host country can push a possible solution to climate change
		- Organized by UN
	- Provides opportunity to see what progress has been made
		- Every 5 years -> check in
- **Countries pledges - NDCs**
	- Nationally Determined Contributions
		- Each country needs to come up with a strategy for how to limit climate change and by how much
- **COP28 - where, who**
	- 28th climate conference
	- Dubai, UAE
		- Negotiators from 200 countries from the world
		- But also brings together everybody -> scientists, civil society, business, activists
		- Platform that brings together all major players in climate change
	- Over 7000 people total
		- Need everybody there to talk about it
		- At COP -> can't always afford to get into the room even if they really need to
- **How to measure progress**
	- How can we give everybody access to it so that we hear all voices
- **Why should we care about what happens at COP**
	- Managed to halve global warming since 1995
	- Money to poorer countries, etc.
		- Brings attention to CC
		- Positive light

**Paris agreement** 
- All nations committed to reducing carbon emissions as soon as possible
	- Keep global warming below 2 degrees
- Problem:
	- Not legally binding
	- No specific timelines
- **Commitments**: Countries set their own climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs).
- **Net-zero goal**: Aim for global carbon neutrality by mid-century.
- **Review process**: Countries submit updated NDCs every five years.
- **Financial support**: Developed nations commit to helping developing countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate impacts.
	- Developed countries need to take the lead, provide extra resources, etc.


**Climate timeline**
- **UNFCCC (1990)**
	- Negotiations started for tackling climate change
- **Rio Earth Summit (1992)**
	- First UN 'Earth Summit'
	- UNFCCC is adopted internationally (eventually 200+ countries)
	- Goal of preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system
- **Kyoto Protocol (1997 - COP 3, Kyoto)**
	- Legally binding agreement for emissions targets
		- ==Only developed countries== 
			- USA withdraws in 2000
	- Precise details TBD at following COPs
		- I.e. Marrakech Accords (2001)
			- Details for the Kyoto protocol
- **Paris Agreement (2015 - COP 21, Paris)**
	- 195 nations pledging to try and limit temperature rise to 1.5C
		- Submit first NDC (climate pledge) 
		- Become net zero by second half of century
		- ==Global stocktake== every 5 years -> increase national pledges for accountability (ratchet up level of NDC)
- **Glasgow (2021 - COP 26, Glasgow)**
	- 2025 NDCs -> must give new ones
	- 2030 NDCs -> update them
	- Want to create mid-century plan
		- End coal power plants, start natural climate solutions (i.e. trees), mandate financial actors to integrate climate risks
