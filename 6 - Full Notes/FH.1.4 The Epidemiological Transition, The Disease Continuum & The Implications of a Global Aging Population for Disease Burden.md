# FH.1.4 The Epidemiological Transition, The Disease Continuum & The Implications of a Global Aging Population for Disease Burden

**Disease continuum:** the range of possible diseases
- Can differ not only internationally but also domestically 

**Diseases of poverty:** diseases found in poorer countries (i.e. malnutrition, maleria, river blindness, cholera) (generally communicable)
- Caused by:
	- Poor diet
	- Poor hygiene
	- Water borne parasites and bacteria
	- Other pests
	- Poor public health facilities + lack of information/education

**Diseases of affluence:** diseases found in countries that industrialize and become wealthier (i.e. heart disease, obesity, strokes, cancer) (generally non-communicable)
- Caused by:
	- Increased longevity
	- Environmental quality 
	- Combined impact of over-consumption and lifestyle

**5 categories of global distribution of health risks (categories of countries)
- **Low risk countries** 
	- International standard of health care available in all (populated) parts of the country
	- Widely available specialist and general care
	- High quality emergency, dental facilities and prescription medication
	- Low risk of infectious disease
- **Medium risk countries**
	- Some high some low standard of health care
	- Adequate emergency and dental services
	- Some food and water borne diseases
- **High risk countries**
	- Limited medical services and basic emergency/dental
	- Not much prescription (may be counterfeited/stored improperly)
	- Serious infections (i.e. typhoid, malaria) are present
- **Extreme risk countries**
	- Non-existent or extremely taxed/expensive health care
	- No available emergency/dental services
	- No prescription 
	- High risk of food and water borne disease
	- Serious infections are common
- **Large rapidly developing countries**
	- Great differences in health care between major cities vs rest of countries
	- Major cities -> healthcare is high standard/international
	- Small towns -> very basic, counterfeit medicines, serious illnesses

**Diseases of burden:** the diseases that cause the most problem for society (can be both NCD and CD)
- I.e. 85% NCD in HICs, 54% NCD in LICs and MICs
- **Compression of morbidity:** a decrease in the prevalence of disability as life expectancy increases
	- Others -> argue for the decrease in severe disability in exchange for milder chronic disease
- 3 patterns:
	- Reduction in severe disability rates (Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, USA)
	- Stable rates (even for aged populations) (Australia, Canada, France)
	- Increase in severe disability rates (Belgium, Japan, Sweden)
