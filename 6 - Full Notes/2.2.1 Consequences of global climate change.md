# 2.2.1 Consequences of global climate change

- **Place in specific** 

The effects of global climate change are already present -> more widespread with enhanced GHE
- Places at varying levels of economic development -> affected economically and socially
	- **LIC:** If rely on subsistence agriculture or commercial agriculture -> hit hardest
	- **HIC:** Also affected by drought conditions but they are better able to respond to help agricultural communities
- Effects on one part of planet will influence other places as well
	- I.e. boost in revenue in place that produces similar crop without drought
	- Need to provide aid to country that experienced trouble

Planet's spheres: spheres that can classify the surface of the planet when considering global patterns and processes
- **Lithosphere**: the solid component of the earth's surface, comprising the curst and the upper mantle beneath it
- **Hydrosphere**: the Earth's water, whether in solid, liquid or gaseous form - and whether fresh or saline
- **Atmosphere**: the layer of gases surrounding the earth and held to the Earth's surface by gravity
- **Biosphere**: comprises all the living things on Earth regardless of whether they are located within the lithosphere, the atmosphere or the hydrosphere
