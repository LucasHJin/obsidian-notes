# FH.1.2 The Nutrition Transition

**Nutrition transition:** Model used to describe the shifts in diets, physical activity and causes of disease that accompany changes in economic development, lifestyle, urbanization, and demography
- **Sedentary:** tending to spend much time seated; somewhat inactive
- Commonly used to refer to change in diet towards *Western diets*
	- I.e. rich in fats, sugars, meats, processed foods
	- Low in fibre
	- Rise in sedentary activity
- Rise in obesity
	- In USA -> very quick
		- Rise in diabetes risk (prevalence of 10.5% in 2018)
- Nutrition Transitions:
	- **Pattern 1:** Collecting Food
		- Hunter gatherer peoples who eat unprocessed
			- A lot of carbs and fibre, low fat
		- No obesity -> constantly moving to find food
	- **Pattern 2:** Famine
		- Fixed location -> Grow own food but not a lot of food (not enough calories)
			- More vulnerable to any sudden events
		- Mainly some grains (diet becomes less diverse because control over diet)
		- Inequalities start appearing -> malnutrition in less empowered members
	- **Pattern 3:** Receding Famine
		- Industrialization -> winder range of foods to feed all workers
			- Mostly starchy food (animal foods r small proportion)
			- Diet starts to *diversify*
		- Able to obtain enough calories and micronutrients
		- Activity starts to die down
	- **Pattern 4:** Chronic Disease
		- Industrialization of agriculture and food production
			- Greater consumption of convenience foods (high in fat, cholesterol, sugar)
		- Adoption of mass media + exposure to advertisements
		- Shift to sedentary lifestyle
			- Increase in obesity and degenerative diseases (i.e. diabetes II)
		- Globalization is rapidly spreading this to LICs with current Pattern 2 and 3
			- (transporting food is easier)
			- Some local farmers are changing production
		- By 2030 -> over nutrition diseases > undernutrition diseases in LICs and NICs
	- **Pattern 5:** Behavioural change
		- Change in behaviour to avoid ultra processed food (more vegetables)
			- In higher economic countries where people become conscious of diets
			- Longer life without disease
		- Change in mannerisms, activity, etc.
- **Criticisms:** 
	- Should be viewed as 3 overlapping transitions (not necessarily same time/rate)
		- Diet, physical environment, culture
	- Not a convergence on one single diet
		- Convergent diet outcomes (i.e. more processed) -> but different flavors/foods
	- LICs won't grow the same way as HICs in the past (because of international trade deals)
	- Stage 1 doesn't tackle seasonal food shortages
	- Stage 2 reduction in height might be because of increased diseases from densely packed population (not food)
	- Current measures of changing diets are insufficient
		- I.e. highly processed foods still in unprocessed category
	- Stage 5 is hypothetical (no government seriously tackling obesity)
		- But processed food declined in some countries (i.e. Japan, Singapore)
			- Higher socioeconomic people in HICs are generally lower BMI


**Demographic transition:** Shift from high fertility and mortality to low in both

**Epidemiological transition:** Pattern of diseases shifts from infectious caused by malnutrition and poor sanitation to degenerative non-infective (noncommunicable) associated with old age and sedentary urban-industrial lifestyles
