# PDL - Resources

[Docs](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.html) → tutorials + API

- **Kaggle:** A platform for data science and machine learning
	- Has datasets, competitions, notebooks and a community
- **Jupyter notebook:** interactive web-based interface for writing and running Python (and other language) code
	- Can have code in cells, run independently, share output, etc.
		- *Note* → `!` at the start means it’s a bash command
	- Allows you to run Python (i.e. training models) interactively online
	- Can also have markdown cells → to explain your working process
- **Google Colab:** Online version of Jupyter Notebook hosted by Google
	- Very similar to Kaggle → just different limitations on CPU/GPU, etc.
- **PyTorch vs Tensorflow:** both popular deep learning frameworks
	- PyTorch is being used for this course → more Python like code but also very long 
	- **FastAI** → Library built on top of PyTorch to reduce the amount of code to write
		- Uses best practices already
- **Book:** https://github.com/fastai/fastbook?tab=readme-ov-file
