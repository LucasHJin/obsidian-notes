# PDL - Machine Learning Models

*At a high level:* 
- **Normal computer program:** inputs → program → output 
- **Machine learning model:** ![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 4.57.16 PM.png]]
	- **Model** → mathematical function that takes inputs and multiplies by one set of weights and adds them up
		- Repeats for all sets of weights
		- Takes all negative numbers and replaces with 0s
		- Takes that as inputs and repeats for a certain number of layers
	- **Weights** → initially random (not useful)
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 4.59.46 PM.png]] 
		- Calculates loss from results (i.e. how accurate they were) and then uses it to update/fine tune the weights 
		- 
	- **Computable function:** any task that takes an input and gives an output (i.e. translate)
		- Eventually becomes like normal computer program that can be called
