# RL - PAPER SB3

**Stable Baselines 3:** open-source implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in Python
- Are benchmarked against reference codebases + have automated unit tests for 95% of code
- Useful for baseline comparisons because small implementation changes can have big performance effects
- *Goal* → Maintain stable algorithms (1 agent)

**Provided algorithms:** 
- A2C
- PPO
- DDPG
- SAC
- TD3
- HER
- DQN
