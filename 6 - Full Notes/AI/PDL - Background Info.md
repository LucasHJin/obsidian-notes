# PDL - Background Info

**What is deep learning?** 
- Specialty within machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (i.e. image classificationw)

**Modern vs Old Machine Learning:** 
- You no longer need to build features → [[AI explained|Neural networks]] can learn/build the features themselves
	- **Features:** individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data you’re using to make predictions or classifications
		- I.e. key things of note in the inputs that the model uses to learn patterns → i.e. quantitative values like age corresponding to income
	- Can also combine features to create further features
		- Start with a random NN → feed it examples → have it learn and recognize
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 2.52.22 PM.png|500]] 
- *Note:* foundational techniques can be used in all types of NN
	- I.e. image classifier can be used to classify sounds (i.e. convert one set of data into an image form to classify even if not originally image data)
	- **Segmentation:** colour in pixels based on what each object is
- *Note* → Deep learning is a specific part of the more general discipline of *[[PDL - Machine Learning Models|machine learning]]* 

**Current deep learning usecases:** 
- Natural language processing, Computer vision, Medicine, Biology, Image generation, Recommendation systems, Playing games, Robotics, etc.
