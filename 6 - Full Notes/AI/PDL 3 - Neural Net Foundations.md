# PDL 3 - Neural Net Foundations

**Remember:** [[PDL - Training a model]] 
- Can improve models by using a more proper architecture (i.e. instead of ResNet)
- **[[PDL - Terminology|Architecture]]:** mathematical functions defined by matrix multiplications and non-linearities
	- Care about → how fast, how much memory, how accurate
	- Naming → tells you size of model + if they have been trained on more data
*Note:* using more models
- Need to use `pip install timm` to use most models from PyTorch (FastAI doesn’t have that many)

___
**Learner:** 2 parts
- What you did to turn images into things for the model
- The model itself
- *Notes:* 
	- Contains many layers (+ nested layers)
