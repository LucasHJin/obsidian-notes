# PDL 5 - Embeddings

**[[PDL - Terminology|Embeddings]]:** dense vectors (smaller dimensions) to capture similarity
- *Note* → embeddings are continuous 

**Use cases:** 
- Can combine continuous embedding values with continuous input data (concatenate and then feed into first dense layer)
	- Transform categorical into continuous before combining with continuous (everything becomes continuous)
