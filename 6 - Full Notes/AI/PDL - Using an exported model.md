# PDL - Using an exported model

After you export → can use it in other code
- Need to paste in any external function used in data labelling
- Use `load_learner(FILE_NAME)` → exact same as what you get when you finish training
	- `.predict` → very fast

**[[PDL - Deploying a model|Hugging Face API:]]** 
- Can get an API key for any model that is deployed
	- Attach this to a [[Full Stack explained|web app]]
