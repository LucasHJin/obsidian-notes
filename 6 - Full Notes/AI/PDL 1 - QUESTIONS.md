# PDL 1 - QUESTIONS

1. Do you need these for deep learning? **NO**
    - Lots of math T / F
    - Lots of data T / F
    - Lots of expensive computers T / F
    - A PhD T / F
2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.
    X
3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
    X
4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
    Processing units, activation, output function, pattern of connectivity, propogation rule, activation rule, learning rule, envirnoment
5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
    Single neutrons can’t learn math functions, too slow/big
6. What is a GPU?
    graphical processing unit – (parallel processing)
7. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?
    Code is run by python → 2
8. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.
    
9. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.
    
10. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?
    
11. What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?
    Value of model parameters → maximize model performance by changing weights using loss function
12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?
    parameters - two types (weights vs bias)
13. Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.
    
14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?
    too many layers → to difficult to pinpoint factor behind decision
15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?
    
16. What do you need in order to train a model?
    Architecture, data (labelled), loss function, method to optimize parameters
17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?
    
18. Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?
    No → bigger = more accurate but slower
19. What is the difference between classification and regression?
    Predicting a class vs numeric quantity
20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?
    Validation → tune hyperparameters, Test → train model
21. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?
    
22. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?
    
23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.
    
24. What is a metric? How does it differ from "loss"?
    
25. How can pretrained models help?
    
26. What is the "head" of a model?
    
27. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?
    
28. Are image models only useful for photos?
    
29. What is an "architecture"?
    
30. What is segmentation?
    
31. What is `y_range` used for? When do we need it?
    
32. What are "hyperparameters"?
    
33. What's the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?
