# DL - CNN explained

Made up of convolutional layers

**Convolutional layer:** type of layer in neural networks that’s good at understanding images
- Uses a kernel (small filter) like a sliding window
	- Checks for specific patterns in each window → if it finds it, it sends a signal
- Each layer can learn many filters
	- More layers = more details
	- *Note* → deeper layers look at the feature maps of previous layer to learn how they interact (not raw image)
- *Stride* → hyperparameter that dictates how large the window is of pixels
