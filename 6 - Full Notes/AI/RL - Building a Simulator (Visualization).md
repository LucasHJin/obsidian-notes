# RL - Building a Simulator (Visualization)

**[PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/):** high level API that abstracts the Visualization Tool Kit (C++) and uses mesh data structures + 3d plotting
- **Mesh:** a way to represent a 3D object using points, edges, and faces
	- Faces are edges connected together → show the object
	- *Any spatially referenced dataset* 
- Highly integrated with NumPy
	- Can access at `pyvista.Dataset.___` 
	- Can generate PyVista objects from NumPy arrays → useful for plotting paths
