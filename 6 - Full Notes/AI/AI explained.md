# AI explained

### AI vs ML vs NNs vs LLMs vs RL
**Artificial Intelligence:** refers to machines designed to simulate human intelligence (encompasses everything)
- Anything with rule based systems / learning algorithms
- **Machine Learning:** algorithms that learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed
	- **Classical ML:** (SVMs, kNN, Decision Trees, etc.)
	- Goal → improve performance over time using more data
	- **Neural Networks:** learning algorithm inspired by the brain → made up of layers of “neurons” that learn from representations of data
		- Subset of ML
		- Used for ==image recognition, speech, natural language processing, etc.== 
		- **Large Language Models:** type of neural network specialized for language
			- Trained on massive text datasets
			- Generate/understand language
			- Based on → ***Transformers*** 
				- Neural network architecture designed to process sequential data, like text, much more efficiently than older models
				- Decide which words to focus on before processing + parallel processing (all tokens)
	- **Deep Learning:** subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers
		- Needs large amounts of data
	- **Reinforcement Learning:** learning algorithm where agents learn through rewards/punishments
		- Trial and error learning
- **Generative AI:** any AI system that creates new content (i.e. text, music, images, code, etc.) by learning from patterns in data (cross-cuts multiple subfields)
	- Not just classifying/predicting
	- *LLMs* (specific application of generative AI)**→ text generation, *GANs* → image, video generation, *Diffusion models* → image, video generation
- **Discriminative AI:** learning the boundaries that separate different classes or categories in the training data
	- Just try to classify (not generate)
