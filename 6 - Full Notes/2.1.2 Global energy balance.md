# 2.1.2 Global energy balance

**Earth's energy balance:** 
- Referred to budget/balance
	- Always releasing the same amount of energy that is gained
- This is what enables it to be stable temperature
	- Disruption to budget = climate change
- This state of balance = **Global radiative equilibrium** 
	- I.e. processes of **conduction, convection, infrared radiation, evaporation** all part of this balance
	- I.e. -100 units needs to be balanced by +100 units
- Consider at 3 levels (what happens to the heat in the form of solar radiation):
	- **Surface of the earth**
		- Most solar heating
			- 30% is reflected (albedo)
			- 70% is accepted and reemitted as long-wave radiation
	- **Top of the edge of Earth's atmosphere**
		- Sunlight enters the system
	- **Atmosphere in between** 
	- Each level must have net flux = 0 (equal)

**[[Greenhouse effect explained|Greenhouse effect - geo]]** 
- **Natural Greenhouse Effect**
	- Absorbs short wave radiation (UV, visible) from sun
		- Produces heat that eventually leaves the earth (LW radiation)
	- Atmosphere traps infrared radiation (LW radiation)
		- Reflects it back down to the Earth -> keeps us heated
		- Not always but will return at least once
- **Enhanced Greenhouse Effect** 
	- The natural greenhouse effect ouf of balance
		- Human activity has increased the proportion of GHGs in the atmosphere -> no longer a balance between incoming and outgoing energy
			- Traps heat in the atmosphere

**Natural causes of climate change:**  
- ==CALLED CLIMATE FORCINGS== 
- Global energy balance is not static
	- **Radiative forcing:** Change in balance between insolation and energy radiated back to space
	- **Forcing agents:** Pressures and processes that cause radiative forcing
		- **External forcing agents vs Internal forcing agents** 
			- Outside Earth vs On surface of Earth
- **Orbital forcing** ==(Milankovitch cycles)== 
	- Changes in how the Earth orbits the sun
	- **Eccentricity:** shape of the orbit changes over time
		- Sometimes circular, sometimes elliptical -> changes between the two every 100,000 years
		- Circle -> constant temperature
		- Elliptical -> sometimes warmer during the year, sometimes colder
	- **Obliquity:** The rotation of the Earth on its own tilted axis
		- Angle of axis changes overtime (41,000 year period)
			- Reason for seasons
	- **Procession:** The earth is always wobbling slowly
		- Takes 26,000 years to complete one circular wobble
			- Affects amount of solar energy each hemisphere receives
			- Responsible for timing of seasons
- **Solar activity** 
	- Flickers and doesn't always have same brightness
		- More sunspots = higher temp
		- Every 11 years ish
	- Maunder minimum
		- Regions in time where sunspots don't occur for a long period of time
- **Volcanoes + asteroid** 
	- Particles like dust can reflect solar radiation back to space (reduces incoming solar energy)
		- Lowers temperature (short term climate change - months to years)
		- Happens for both volcanoes and asteroids

**Insolation:** the amount of measured radiation received by the surface of the earth
- (Incoming solar radiation)
