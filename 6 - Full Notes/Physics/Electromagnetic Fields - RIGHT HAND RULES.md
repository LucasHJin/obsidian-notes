# Electromagnetic Fields - RIGHT HAND RULES

**RHR for current in wire/loop** 
- Option 1:
	- Thumb = current
	- Curled fingers = magnetic field
- Option 2: 
	- Thumb = magnetic field
	- Curled fingers = current

**RHR for F, I/V, B** 
- Thumb = current/velocity/direction of charged positive particle
	- Current if a wire is placed in a magnetic field
	- Velocity if only 1 electron (^above represents many electrons being affected)
- **F**ingers = Magnetic **F**ield
- Palm = Force (like slap)
	- Use left hand with same configuration for electron

**RHR for Lenz's Law** 
- Thumb = direction of motion (**cause**) 
- Fingers = magnetic field
- Thumb = direction of current (**effect**)

**RHR with 2 wires:** 
- Thumb = current
- Fingers = where force is originating from (other wire)
- Palm = unknown (direction of magnetic field)
