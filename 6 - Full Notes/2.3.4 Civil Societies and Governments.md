# 2.3.4 Civil Societies and Governments

**Civil society:** everything outside of the government that establishes the interest of the citizens
- I.e. NGOs, institutions, individuals and local groups of people
	- Typically independent and self-governing
- Part of **Power** of 4 P's
	- Allows for everybody's voice to be heard (bottom-up method)
- Strategies:
	- Research, conferences, networking, raising awareness (advocacy, petitions, lobbying, campaigns, protests, demonstrations, boycotts)
		- Direct action -> help out those who are unable to deal with climate change themselves (i.e. wells in Africa)

**Corporate society:** Corporate businesses who attempt to battle climate change for personal profit
- I.e. physical risk, price risk, product risk, rating risk, regulation risk, reputation risk
	- Need to balance profits with climate change mitigation to prevent above risks
	- 1-3 = value chain risk (relate to corporation and operations)
	- 4-6 = external shareholder risk (relate to corporations' relationship with wider community)
- Responses:
	- Denial, adaptation, diversification, marketing strategies, infrastructure modification

**Case study:**
