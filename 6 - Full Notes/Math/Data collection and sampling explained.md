# Data collection and sampling explained

**Statistical analysis:** analysis of data
- **Population:** The entire group that you want your data to describe or make inferences about, or all of the possible values for a group that is being investigated
- **Sample:** Subset of data from population.

**How to collect and categorize data:**
- Can organize by **descriptive statistics** for a population or group
- **Types of data:**
	- Discrete data: Data that is counted with distinct values.
		- I.e. number of items in a box
	- Continuous data: Data that is measured on a continual scale.
		- I.e. is a certain object between weight A and weight B

**Reliability of data:**
- Is it free from errors/bias
	- I.e. no problems from improper data collection
	- I.e. no biases (ideals that cause overestimation/underestimation)

**Outliers in data:**
- Can be a naturally occurring extraordinary value
- Can also be a value that is the result of abnormal circumstances
- Can be identified and shown on [[Box and whisker plot explained|a box and whisker plot]]

**Sampling:** Technique used to get data from which we can draw accurate conclusions
- Only takes from a subset of the group
	- I.e. elections -> not everyone votes but still enough of the right people to get an accurate idea

**Size of sampling:**
- Hard to generalize (depends on the experiment)
- Typically want more, not less
	- If choosing a sample, be sure to be able to explain why that is enough

**Sampling techniques/methods:**
- ==NOTE: all good samples are random (all potential data points have an equal probability of being chosen)==
