# Modelling related events - Probability

**Models:**
- **Venn Diagram:** A model illustrating two or more sets of data using overlapping circles to show how elements belong to the different sets.

- **Tree Diagram:** A model of sequential events that each have multiple outcomes, with each outcome forming a branch to a different possibility.
	- Basically just splits each time there is a (EQUAL) chance of some things happening (useful for 2+ events)

**What are related events?**
- Events that happen in some relation to one another
- **Intersection:** The set of elements formed from two sets by taking only the subset of elements that belong to both sets.

	- $\operatorname{P}(A \cap B)$ 
- **Union:** The set of elements formed by combining all the elements in two sets of data.
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-11 at 1.04.56 PM.png|300]] 
	- $\operatorname{P}(A\cup B)=\operatorname{P}(A)+\operatorname{P}(B)-\operatorname{P}(A \cap B)$  
- **Mutually exclusive events:** Two events that do not have an **intersection**. The occurrence of one means that the other cannot occur.
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-11 at 1.05.06 PM.png|300]] 
	- $\operatorname{P}(A\cup B) = \operatorname{P}(A)+\operatorname{P}(B)$ (because $\operatorname{P}(A \cap B)=0$)

**Dependent Event:** Two events that occur such that if one occurs, it has an effect on the probability of the other event.
- Affect each other
	- I.e. drawing cards without replacing
**Independent Event:** Two events that occur such that the occurrence of one event has no impact on the probability of the other event occurring.
- No effect on each other
	- I.e. drawing cards with replacing
