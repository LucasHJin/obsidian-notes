# Isoclines explained

**NOT PART OF IB**

## Isoclines:
- A curve on a graph connecting points of equal slope (c).
	- Corresponds to $y'=F(x,y)$ with a curve equation of $F(x,y)=c$
		- Tangent line to curve are: $y'(x)=F(x,y)=c$
		- Solutions to $y'=c$
- Essentially represents the points where the slope of the solution curve is $c$

## Example: $y'=x-2y+y^2$
- $c=0$:
	- $x-2y+y^2=0$
	- $x=-y^2+2y$
		- Horizontal parabola, vertex $(1,1)$
- $c=1$:
	- $x-2y+y^2=1$
	- $x=-y^2+2y+1$
		- Horizontal parabola, vertex $(2,1)$

	- Red lines = how the solution curve crosses the isoclines (based on c)
		- With the isoclines and the starting point -> can estimate the solution curve by sketching a curve that crosses the isoclines at a slope equal to the constant of each isocline
- I.e. starting at $(0,1)$ and crossing through isocline at $c=0$ to $c=1$

- Draw more isoclines for more accuracy

## Example 2:
- $y'=2xy$

- Shows slope field, handful of isoclines and 1 possible solution curve

**Benefits:**
- Much faster than slope fields
