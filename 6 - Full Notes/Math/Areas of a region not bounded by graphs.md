# Areas of a region not bounded by graphs

Can be used to find the area between:
- ==2 curves==
	- Take definite integral with respect to x
	- Need to calculate multiple times if the graphs cross over each other
	- (Can also be respect to $y$ depending on which is simpler)
- ==Curve and x axis==
	- Just do it the normal way (taking integral with respect to x)
		- Can find intersections to find $a$ and $b$ 
	- Remember that if it crosses the x axis, it subtracts (not absolute value)
- ==Curve and y axis==
	- Can just perform same calculations as normal except with $y$ instead of $x$ 
	- If $g(y)\leq f(y)$ where $a<y<b$, the area bound by $x=f(y), x=g(y), y=a, y=b$ is:
		$\qquad \int\limits_a^b f (y) - g(y){\rm{d}}y$
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-02 at 5.25.41 PM.png|400]]
		- Ensures that you can just do one definite integral instead of multiple based on which equation is on top
