# VOR - Y Axis

**How?**
- Just perform all the volume of revolution same as ([[VOR - X Axis]]) but with respect to y instead of x (changing variables)

**If y-axis:**
- ==Conditions:==
	- Let $f$ be a continuous function (of the variable $y$) on the interval $[a,b]$ 
	- Let $f(y)\geq 0$ for $a<y<b$ 
	- Let $R$ be the region bounded by the $y$-axis, graph of $f$ and the lines $y=a$, $y=b$ 
- ==For the volume of the solid generated by rotating $R$ $360^{\circ}$ around the y-axis:
	- $V=\int\limits_a^b \pi  f{(y)^2}{\rm{d}}y$ 

**If rotating 2 functions around x axis and want area cut out:**
- ==Conditions:==
	- Let $f$ and $g$ be a continuous function (of the variable $y$) on the interval $[a,b]$ 
	- Let $f(y)>g(y)\geq 0$ for $a<y<b$ 
	- Let $R$ be the region bounded by the graphs of $f$ and $g$ and the lines $y=a$, $y=b$ 
- ==Volume after rotating both graphs 360 around the y-axis:==
	- $V=\int\limits_a^b \pi  \left({f{{(y)}^2} - g{{(y)}^2}} \right){\rm{d}}y$ 
		- $f$ is the function that is more far from the y-axis
		- Still use negatives on bottom, positives on top

**Example:**

- You rotate around the y-axis because it goes over x axis so it would cut into itself
