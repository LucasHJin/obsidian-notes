# Cumulative frequency curves explained

**NOTE:** *Vertical axis always cumulative frequency, horizontal axis always independent variable* 
- Slope always $\geq 0$ 

As explained in [[Presentation of data explained]]:
- **Cumulative frequency table:** Table where frequency of each class is added onto all the previous frequencies
- **Cumulative frequency polygon:** The data points are connected by straight lines
	- Implies a linear distribution of the data points within an interval

- **Cumulative frequency curve:** All the data points are connected by a smooth curve

**Benefits:**
- Allows to explore the 5-number summary much easier
	- I.e. median is at middle height of the largest
		- Draw the CFP or CFC and then find the point at $y/2$ and find the $x$-coord for that
	- Same for $Q_1$ and $Q_3$  
- Can also make a [[Box and whisker plot explained]] from this
