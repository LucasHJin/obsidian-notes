# Integral as a limit
**Riemann Sum:** An approximation of an integral using a finite sum of areas, typically using areas of rectangles.
- Basically if you use smaller and smaller rectangles, you can approximate the area under a curve
- In math:
	- If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $a=x_0<x_1<...<x_n=b$ and $x_{i-1}\leq x_{i}^{*} \leq x_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ then: $\qquad \int^{a}_{b} f(x)dx \approx f(x_1^*)({x_1} - {x_0}) +  \ldots  + f(x_n^*)({x_n} - {x_{n - 1}}) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n f (x_i^*)({x_i} - {x_{i - 1}})$![[Screenshot 2024-08-02 at 5.43.40 PM.png]]
- Related to **uniform continuity:** A point is continuous if $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=f(c)$
	- An interval is continuous if it is continuous at each interior point within the interval.
