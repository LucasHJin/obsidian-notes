# Error term explained

==NOT IN IB==

**Lagrange form - error term:**
- Given that $f$ is a function that is differentiable $n+1$ times around $a$ in the domain and that the $nth$ derivative is continuous on the closed interval between $a$ and $x$: 
	- $f(x) = f(a) + (x - a)f'(a) + \dfrac{{{{(x - a)}^2}}}{{2!}}f''(a) +  \cdots  + \dfrac{{{{(x - a)}^n}}}{{n!}}{f^{(n)}}(a) + {R_n}(x)$ 
		- ${R_n}(x) = \dfrac{{{f^{(n + 1)}}(c)}}{{(n + 1)!}}{(x - a)^{n + 1}}$
			- Where $c$ is between $x$ and $a$ 
		- First part is just the Taylor polynomial (and then you add error term to get original function)
- Can provide estimation of how much error is incurred
