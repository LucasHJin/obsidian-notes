# Presentation of data explained

**Why?**
- It is much easier to find trends, relationships, make inferences, etc. when data is compiled in **meaningful models** rather than **raw data** 

**Grouped data:** 
- If you have a large amount of data -> various ways you can group it
- For **discrete data** (counted)
	- I.e. for the amount of grapes per bunch:
		- To create a clear pattern, you can create **intervals** or **classes**

			- ==**Frequency distribution table** ==
		- Provides a clearer overview of the amount of grapes a bunch is most likely to have

			- ==**Frequency diagram** ==
				- NOTE: columns don't touch because data is **discrete** (can be counted)
- For **continuous data** (measured):
	- I.e. height of students:

		- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 7.32.17 PM.png|400]] 
- **For both:**
	- Can also represent with the sum of current and all previous **intervals**

		- ==**Cumulative frequency diagram** ==
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 7.34.44 PM.png|400]] 
		- ==**Cumulative frequency graph**== 
- **Characteristics of data in Intervals/Classes:**
	- ==mid-interval values== 
	- ==interval width== (though it is not common to have a varying interval width)
	- ==lower interval boundary==
	- ==upper interval boundary==
		- Can be the same as lower interval boundary for continuous data
	- ==modal class== (class with highest frequency -> **ONLY FOR FREQUENCY DIAGRAM, NOT CUMULATIVE**)
- *Note that if you need to choose a value for grouped data, choose the mid-interval value*

**Quartiles:** The three values in a data set that divide the data into four equal portions.
- Helps with finding the **percentile** of a value:
	- A value below which a given percentage of the data is included.
	- Quartile is most common type
- ==**5-number summary**:==
	- **Minimum**: lowest value of a data set
	- **First quartile** ($Q_1$): 25th percentile
		- Median below median (ONLY BELOW)
	- **Second quartile** ($Q_2$): 50th percentile, known as **median** 
	- **Third quartile** ($Q_3$): 75th percentile
		- Median above median (ONLY ABOVE)
	- **Maximum**: highest value of a dataset
- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 7.45.00 PM.png|400]] 
- **Interquartile range (IQR):** The range between the the third quartile and the first quartile
	- $IQR=Q_3-Q_1$
