# VOR - X Axis

**How?**
- Pretend Riemann sum / Definite Integral with respect to x is the radius
	- Because at any one point on the curve, the distance from the curve to the x axis is the radius if you imagine a full 360 degree rotation

**If x-axis:**
- ==Conditions:==
	- Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$ 
	- Let $f(x)\geq 0$ for $a<x<b$ 
	- Let $R$ be the region bounded by the $x$-axis, graph of $f$ and the lines $x=a$, $x=b$ 
		- (Area under the curve)
- ==For the volume of the solid generated by rotating $R$ $360^{\circ}$ around the $x$-axis:==
	- $V = \int\limits_a^b \pi  f{(x)^2}{\rm{d}}x$ 
		- $^2$ is on the inside because you want to integrate the area of the cross sectional circle, not of the area under the curve
			- $\pi f(x)^2$ gives a cross section cut through the solid, the integral is what gives it length


**If rotating 2 functions around x axis and want area cut out:**
- Often creates rings/objects with holes in the middle
	- ![[Pasted image 20240802231320.png|150]]
	- Generated solid is the difference between:
		- the solid generated by rotating the region below the graph of 𝑓 and
		- the solid generated by rotating the region below the graph of 𝑔.
- ==Conditions:==
	- Let $f$ and $g$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$ 
	- Let $f(x)>g(x)\geq 0$ for $a<x<b$ 
	- Let $R$ be the region bounded by the graphs of $f$ and $g$ and the lines $x=a$, $x=b$ 
- ==Volume after rotating both graphs 360 around the x-axis:==
	- $V=\int\limits_a^b \pi  f{(x)^2}{\rm{d}}x - \int\limits_a^b \pi  g{(x)^2}{\rm{d}}x = \int\limits_a^b \pi  \left({f{{(x)}^2} - g{{(x)}^2}} \right){\rm{d}}x$ 
		- *Note that it is the difference of squares, not the square of diff*
