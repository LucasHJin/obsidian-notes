## Slope fields
A graphical representation of the rate-of-change across all values of $x$ and $y$ over a given domain and range
- For a differential equation:
	- $y'=F(x,y)$
		- if a solution curve goes through $(x_0,y_0)$ → the slope of the tangent at that point $=m=y'(x_0)=F(x_0,y_0)$
			- Not multiplication, $y'$ is a function
- How to draw:
	- Draw little line segments at points on a rectangular grid to illustrate the tangent line to a solution curve passing through the points of the grid
		- These will guide the grid
		- Is collection of line segments with slope $F(x,y)$ drawn at all points $(x,y)$ on the plane → vertical line segment if $F(x,y)$ is undefined
- Helpful for sketching solution curves based on initial premises:
	- I.e. $\dfrac{{{\rm{d}}y}}{{{\rm{d}}x}} =  - y\dfrac{{1 + xy}}{{1 - xy}}$
		- If $y(0)=2$ vs if $y(0)=-1$
			- In this case it is $y(x)$ because $y$ depends on $x$

	- If given a slope field, you can test slopes at a point to find out which equation/graph

**Negatives:**
- Very tedious to build a dense enough slope field
