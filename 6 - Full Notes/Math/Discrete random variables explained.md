# Discrete random variables explained

**Probability distribution:** the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment paired with the probabilities of those outcomes
- Can be either discrete or continuous depending on independent variable:
	- **Discrete random variable:** Distinct values separated from other values, typically from counting
		- I.e. [[Binomial distribution explained|binomial distribution]] 
		- [[Probability distributions and DRV explained]]
	- **Continuous random variable:** A range of values, typically from measuring
		- I.e. [[Normal distribution explained|normal distribution]] 

**Expected value:** The value you would expect to obtain on average if you performed an experiment many times.
