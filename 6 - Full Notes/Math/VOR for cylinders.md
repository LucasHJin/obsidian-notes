# VOR for cylinders
https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/IntAppsIntro.aspx
- Cylinder -> for any cases where the shape of a disk or ring doesn't cover it
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-03 at 9.34.53 AM.png|450]]
	- **Formula:** $\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi rh=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi x(f(x))$  
	- ==To note:==
		- Rotation about vertical axis gives a function of $x$ and vice versa
			- Opposite of rings
		- Don't take a complete range of $x$ and $y$ for the limits of integration -> just a range for one side of the solid

**Example:**
- For the above diagram, the curve is represented by $y=(x-1)(x-3)^2$ and at any one point, the distance from center is $x$:
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-03 at 9.40.20 AM.png|500]]
- So:
	- $V=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi x(f(x))=\int_{a}^{b} 2\pi x(x-1)(x-3)^2=\frac{24\pi}{5}$ 
- This works because when calculating the outer volume, the radius may overcount the inner but then it is subtracted when calculating the inner portion of the function
