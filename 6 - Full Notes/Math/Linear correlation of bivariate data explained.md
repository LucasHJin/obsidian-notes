# Linear correlation of bivariate data explained

**Correlation:** A measure used to quantify the possible relationship between two variables.
- I.e. strength and existence of relationship
	- *Not a cause and effect necessarily*

**Bivariate data:** Data that are collected in pairs that are usually recorded as points $(x,y)$.
- $x$ is independent variable (horizontal, plugged in)
- $y$ is dependent variable (vertical, obtained)
- The relationship between the independent and dependent can be modelled with [[Linear correlation explained]]
	- Can be evaluated with [[Correlation strength explained]]

Used to create [[Correlation predictions explained|predictions]]:
