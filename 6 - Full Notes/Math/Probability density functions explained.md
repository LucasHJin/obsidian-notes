# Probability density functions explained

Review:
- **Continuous random variable:** A variable with a value that is contained within a range; it is measured.
	- [[Discrete random variables explained]] 
	- Infinite possible outcomes

___
**Probability density function:** A function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
- (You can't list outcomes in a [[Presentation of data explained|frequency distribution table]] because there are infinite values) 
- $P(a<x<b)=$ the area under the curve and between $x=a, x=b$ 
	- Use [[Derivative and Integration CheatSheet|integration]] 
- ==**Determining if the PDF is valid:**==
	- Area under $f(x)=1$ -> because the total probability must be $1$ 
	- $f(x)\geq 0$ for the entire domain (probability must be positive)
- *Note: The probability of any specific outcome occurring is zero (because infinite outcomes)* 
	- I.e. $P(x=c)=0$
