# Measures of CT and D explained

Even when 2 sets have very different data values, they can have the same statistics (**mean, median, mode, range**)
- To fix this, we can use measurements of:
	- [[Measures of central tendency explained]]
		- Mean, median and mode
	- [[Measures of dispersion explained]]
		- Variance and standard deviation

**NOTE: For transformations with CT and D:**
- When adding or subtracting the same value to all the data in a set, the mean will increase or decrease by the same amount, but the standard deviation will remain the same
- If each data point is multiplied or divided by a constant factor, then the spread does change
	- **Mathematically** (for a data set ${x}$, mean $\mu_x$, SD $\sigma_x$, variance $\sigma_x^2$, multiplied by $c$):
		- Mean: $c\mu_x$ 
		- SD: $|c|\sigma_x$ 
		- Variance: $c^2\sigma_x^2$
