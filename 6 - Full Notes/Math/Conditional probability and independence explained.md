# Conditional probability and independence explained

Recap:
- Explored in [[Probability of related events explained]] 

**Conditional probability:** The probability of an event given that another event has occurred
- (the second event is dependent on the first one)
- Formula:
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({A{\rm{|}}B} \right) = \dfrac{{{\rm{P}}\left({A \cap B} \right)}}{{{\rm{P}}\left(B \right)}}$ 
		- ${\rm{P}}\left({A{\rm{|}}B} \right)$ - probability of A occurring given that B occurred
		- $\rm{P}\left({A \cap B} \right)$ - probability of the intersection of A and B
		- $\rm{P}(B)$ - probability of B

**Independent events:** Events where the occurrence of one event has no impact on the probability that another event will occur
- I.e. [[Binomial distribution explained|binomial distribution]] 
- Mathematical representation:
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({B{\rm{|}}A} \right) = {\rm{P}}\left(B \right)$ 
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({A{\rm{|}}B} \right) = {\rm{P}}\left(A \right)$ 
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({B{\rm{|}}A} \right) = {\rm{P}}\left({B{\rm{|}}A'} \right)$ 
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({A \cap B} \right) = {\rm{P}}\left(A \right){\rm{P}}\left(B \right)$ 
- *DIFFERENT FROM MUTUAL EXCLUSION*
	- Where both **can't** happen in the same case
	- ${\rm{P}}\left({A \cap B} \right) = 0$ 

==**NOTE:** IF 2 EVENTS ARE INDEPENDENT, SO ARE THEIR COMPLEMENT EVENTS==
