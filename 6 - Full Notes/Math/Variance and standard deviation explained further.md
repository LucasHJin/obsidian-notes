# Variance and standard deviation explained further

*This is the case when the data is given in a list*

**Spread:** A description of how the values of a population are distributed, and how much the data set varies from the mean.
- Variance and standard deviation are used to calculate spread


**Variance ($\sigma^2$):** A measure used to describe the spread of data within a population (degree of data dispersion)
- ${\sigma ^2} = \dfrac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{{\left({{x_i} - \mu } \right)}^2}} }}{n}$ 
	- Squaring differences makes it more obvious which sample is more spread out

**Standard deviation ($\sigma$):** A measure used to describe the spread of data within a population.
- $\sigma  = \sqrt {{\sigma ^2}}  = \sqrt {\dfrac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{{\left({{x_i} - \mu } \right)}^2}} }}{n}}$ 
	- Provides more meaning for the context (harder to compare but easier to determine real value)
