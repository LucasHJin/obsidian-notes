# Correlation predictions explained

**Interpreting least-squares regression line:**
- Line of best fit = LSR line
- But it's limited by the y-intercept -> i.e. if x=0, doesn't mean y makes sense
	- I.e. if a student cannot jump horizontally, then they jump −5.24cm up
- 

**Correlation and/or Causation:**
- Just because there is a strong relationship ≠ x causes y
- Need to look at correlation only
	- Can suggest reasons for causation -> but not definitive proof



**Interpolation:** Substituting a value of $x$ that is between the lowest and highest $x$-coordinates of the data set into the equation of the least-squares regression line in order to predict a value of $y$.
- I.e. if you have a data set of 1-15 years, can't plug in 30 years (**extrapolation**) 
- Essentially plugging in where the value is in the correct domain
- **Predictions are best when:**
	- There is a strong correlation
	- The value used for the prediction is between $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$ of the data set

**Extrapolation:** when the model is used to predict outcomes for a data value that is not between the minimum and maximum of the data set
- Can be the reason for invalid $y$ intercept
- **Prediction are sometimes valid**
- Always include a disclaimer


- **DON'T USE $y$ to predict for $x$**
