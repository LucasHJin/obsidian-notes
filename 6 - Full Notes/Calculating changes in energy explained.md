# Calculating changes in energy explained

**To know:** 
- [[Enthalpy explained]] 
- [[Heat and Temperature explained]] 

**Energy changes are determined by temperature changes** 
- $Q=mc\Delta T$ 
	- $Q$: thermal energy (J)
	- $m$: mass (g)
	- $c$: specific heat capacity (J/(gK))
		- quantity of energy needed to raise 1 g of a substance by 1 K
	- $∆T$: change in temperature (C or K)
- $\Delta H=-\frac{Q}{n}$ 
	- $∆H$: change in enthalpy (kJ/mol)
	- $Q$: thermal energy (J)
	- $n$: number of moles of reactant/product (mol)
	- ***Need to convert between kJ and J (divide by 1000)
- For **enthalpy changes in aqueous solution**:
	- Monitor the water solvent (1:1 volume to mass)

**To note:** 
- There can be heat loss
	- When going to the maximum temperature, will lose heat during that time
