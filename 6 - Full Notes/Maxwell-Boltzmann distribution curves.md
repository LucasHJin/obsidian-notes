# Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves

**Energy profile diagrams:** Show the relative amount of energy in the reactants vs products
- Can also show the [[R2.2 How fast? The rate of chemical change|activation energy]] with the hump
	- Need this to break the bonds and achieve **transition state**:
		- A species formed between reactants and products in a chemical reaction when bonds are being broken and new bonds are being formed.
			- (is unstable)
- ![[Screenshot 2024-10-26 at 9.38.43 AM.png]]$\text{Activation energy} = \text{Transition state} - \text{Reactants}$ 

--- 
**Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves:** A statistical model showing the distribution of energies in the molecules contained in a sample of gas.
- Used because not all particles have same kinetic energy
- Is shifted to the left (more particles have lower energy)
- Will always start at 0
- All particles on the left of the activation energy don't have enough energy
	- Only small number of particles have enough
- ![[Screenshot 2024-10-26 at 1.43.54 PM.png|300]] Y axis is number of particles for any energy
- Is effected by [[Factors affecting Rates of Reaction]]
