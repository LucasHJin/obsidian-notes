# Measuring Rates of Reaction - Techniques

Different strategies to use to measure rates of reaction + measuring reactants vs products.

**Changes in volume:** 
- Used for acid-metal reactions producing hydrogen gas
	- Can measure volume of gas with:
		- Gas syringe
			- VT graph
		- Data logger + gas pressure sensor ($V\propto P$)
			- PT graph
			- Both pressure
**Changes in mass:** 
- If gas is produced -> mass will slowly decrease (if removing gas)
	- I.e. metal+acid -> hydrogen gas
	- Can determine RoR based off of mass and time
**Changes in color:** 
- Use a colorimeter to measure the **absorbance/transmittance** of a specific wavelength of light within the solution
	- Measure this over time
	- Increased concentration -> darker -> more absorption/less transmission
		- And vice versa
**Changes in conductivity:** 
- Measure change in ions in the solution
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-10-25 at 10.27.11 PM.png]] I.e. this has 0 ions -> 2 ions
		- So conductivity will increase as reaction progresses
**Rate of precipitation formation:** 
- Use a cross on the bottom of the paper
	- Take measurements as the reaction progresses of the time and how covered up the cross becomes
**Rate of clock reactions:** A clock reaction generally involves a series of chemical reactions where an additional reaction can only occur after the reaction(s) under study is/are complete.
- ==Very rapid precipitate/color formation== 
- Measure the time for visible change of the **final reaction of the series** to occur or repeat itself
- I.e. Iodine clock reaction
	- Iodine produced -> excess iodine reacts with thiosulfate -> remaining iodine reacts with starch for visual change
