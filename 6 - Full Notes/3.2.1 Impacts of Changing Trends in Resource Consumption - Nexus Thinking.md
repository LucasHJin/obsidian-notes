# 3.2.1 Impacts of Changing Trends in Resource Consumption - Nexus Thinking

**Nexus thinking:** What are the points of connection between water, energy and food (WEF Nexus) (interrelationship, interdependence and interactions)
- How to move away from silo thinking (thinking with 'blindfold')
- Covers:
	- How it affects:
		- National water security
		- National food security
		- National energy security
	- Implications of global climate change on WEF nexus:
		- Detailed examples of 2 countries with contrasting levels of resource security
	- Disposal and recycling of consumer items

Example:
- Irrigated agriculture -> requires energy to pump ground water
	- Energy is expensive
	- Irrigation powered by solar pumps is possible solution -> operation costs minimal
	- Farmers receive alternative
		- But if too much ground water -> ecosystems damaged -> agriculture is damaged
- Makes sure that no negatives aspects in other ecosystems affect this ecosystem

**Circularity + WEF Nexus:** 
- **Circular economy:** Repeatedly reusing products/resources (keeping it within economy) to limit resource extraction
	- Opposite of **linear economy** (western)
- Map and analyze the relationships
	- There are smaller loops in bigger loops
		- I.e. water can affect agriculture but pesticides can affect water
		- I.e. energy is required to get water but also is produced by water
	- Bigger loops:
		- Machinery is used to power agriculture which uses water
		- If multiple bad parts like water and energy -> can impact vastly
	- Need to analyze micro and macro
- If you try to fix one part of the resources (WEF) without nexus thinking, can lead to shortages in another
	- I.e. Qatar purchasing fertile well-watered farmland in LICs -> less resources there now
