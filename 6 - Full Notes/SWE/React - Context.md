# React - Context

**Context API:** feature that allows you to manage the global state of your application without the need to pass data through multiple levels of components using props
- I.e. don’t need to pass through multiple parents and children
- Useful for:
	- Auth
	- Light/dark mode
	- Cart systems (ecommerce) 
- ==Alternative option to lifting state up to parents and passing as props==
