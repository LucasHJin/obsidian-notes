# React Native

**What is it?** 
- Open-source framework to develop mobile apps for IOS and Android using [[Javascript Explained|Javascript]] and [[React explained|React]] 
	- Built with reusable components that are translated into the native languages automatically (not faking with web views or needing to manually make it)

**Similarities to React:** 
- Same core concepts of components, states, etc.
- Uses JSX
**Differences to React:** 
- Renders to native UI components instead of the [[Javascript - DOM Manipulation & Events|DOM]] 
- Uses JavaScript-based stylesheets
- Need to use mobile specific APIs (and can’t query DOM with selectors)

**Frameworks:** 
- [[RN - Expo]] 
	- [[Expo - Setting up]]

[[RN - Responsive Styling]]
