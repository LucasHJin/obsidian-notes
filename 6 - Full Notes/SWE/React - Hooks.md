# React - Hooks

**React Hooks:** hooks allow functional components to manage local component state, handle side effects, and use lifecycle features that were previously only available in class components.

**Examples:** 
- [[React - useState]] 
- [[React - useEffect]] 
- [[React - useContext]] 
- [[React - useRef]]
