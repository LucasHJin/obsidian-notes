# React - Hooks

**React Hooks:** hooks allow functional components to manage local component state, handle side effects, and use lifecycle features that were previously only available in class components.
- Basically let you use react features
- **Rules:**
	- Can only be called from top level of a functional component
	- Can’t be called from inside loops

**Examples:** 
- [[React - useState]] 
- [[React - useEffect]] 
- [[React - useContext]] 
- [[React - useRef]]
