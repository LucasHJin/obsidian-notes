# React - Rendering

Screen updates happen in 3 steps:
- Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
- Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
- Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

Can use strict mode to check for mistakes in components
- Calls each twice
