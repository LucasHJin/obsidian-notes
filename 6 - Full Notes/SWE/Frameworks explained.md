# Frameworks explained

**What is it?**
- A structure that you can build software on (foundation so that you don't have to write everything manually)
	- Associated with a specific language
	- Can perform different tasks (frontend vs [[Backend - web development explained|backend]])
- You add higher level functionality for it to work

**Why?**
- Saves time
- Less chance of errors
- More secure code
- Simpler testing and debugging
- Clean and easily adaptable code
- Able to focus on writing code specific to the project
- Can be extended

**Types of frameworks:**
- Web application frameworks
	- Front end
		- Used to build the part of a web application that users interact with directly
		- I.e. Tailwind, React, Angular, etc.
	- Back end
		- Make it easier to handle the server-side logic, database interactions, and application architecture
		- I.e. Express JS, Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask
- Mobile development frameworks
	- I.e. Flutter, Xamarin, etc.

**Libraries vs Frameworks:**
- **Library:** a set of previously-written code that you can use to build your own code
	- Your code calls the library's code (your code is in control)
- **Framework:** a supporting structure (skeleton) that requires specificity
	- Your code must follow the rules/patterns of the framework (the framework is in control)

**Examples:**
- [[Django explained |Django]] (Python)
- ASP.NET Core (JS)
- Laravel (PHP)
