# Docker - Commands

`docker run X` → runs an instance of X if it already exists on the Docker host
- Else, it goes out to Docker Hub to pull the image down (only first time)
- *Note* → when running this, it will go into an exited state afterwards
	- There is nothing to keep the process running
`docker --help` → gives list of all possible Docker commands
