# Rate Expression and Experimental Determination

**Rate expression:** The mathematical expression that describes the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants.
- Also called **rate law** 

**Rate of Reaction:** 
- Measured in how fast the *concentration* of a **reactant** is falling
	- Some affect the rate more than others (all make faster rate but different amounts)
- **Formula:**
	- $\text{Rate}\propto [A]^a[B]^b$ 
		- If concentration has no effect -> $a=0$ 
		- Increases exponentially for any higher values of a and b
			- I.e. $[A]^2$ means that doubling $A$'s concentration quadruples the rate
		- Can be quantified with [[Orders of Reaction Chemistry]] 
	- $\text{Rate}=k[A]^a[B]^b$ 
		- $k$ is the proportionality constant given that the only possible changes are to the concentrations of the reactants

**Determining rate expression experimentally - initial rates method:** 
- Determine effect of changing concentration with respect to each individual reactant (test 1 at a time)
	- I.e. keep B constant and change the concentration of A -> i.e. 2:4 is a $a=2$ and vice versa
