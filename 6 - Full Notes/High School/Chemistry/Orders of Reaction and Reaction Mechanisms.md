# Orders of Reaction and Reaction Mechanisms

**Note:** Rate expression cannot be deduced from reaction equation.
- BUT, it can be deduced for elementary steps of a reaction mechanism
	- Is equal to each reactant in the step raised to its stoichiometric coefficient
		- I.e. $2A\rightarrow k[A]^2$
		- I.e. $AB\rightarrow k[A][B]$
	- This is because it represents the collision of individual particles which will always need to be in the same amount

**If slow step first:** 
- Rate expression of the rate-determining step **equals** the rate expression of the overall reaction

**If slow step not first:** 
- Need to consider the concentration of other species in previous steps as they also influence the rate of the rate determining step
	- Substitute for the intermediates to get only the reactants
	- Example: 
		- $A+B\rightarrow AB\text{ (fast)}$ 
		- $A+AB\rightarrow A_2B\text{ (slow)}$ 
			- $\text{rate}=k[A][AB]=k[A][A][B]=k[A]^2[B]$ 

**Note:** $k$'s units depend on the order of the reaction
- (by rearranging $\text{rate}=k[A]^n$) 
- **Zero:** $k = \text{mol dm}^{−3}\text{ s}^{−1}$ 
- **First:** $k = \text{s}^{−1}$ 
- **Second:** $k = \rm mol^{−1}\;dm^3\;s^{−1}$ 
- **Third:** $k = \rm mol^{−2}\; dm^6\; s^{−1}$
