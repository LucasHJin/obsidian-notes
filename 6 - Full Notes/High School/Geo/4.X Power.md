# 4.X Power

**Superpower**: a nation or a group of nations that is able to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, sometimes simulatenously in more than one place
- Can include economic, cultural, military, geopolitical influence
	- I.e. USA, USSR, OPEC, European Union, China, etc.
		- Economic -> Where are products produced, etc. (globalization)
		- Military influence -> strength in actual fight
- Can be corporation as well (not just countries)
	- I.e. Apple
	- And this can have an impact on the power of a nation (based on where the corporations are from)

**Possibilities:** (world order)
- Not bipolar/multipolar world (how many superpowers)
- Will have 3 different orders
	- **Present:** Global security order (unipolar order)
		- Can send military elsewhere (dependent on USA)
		- USA is the main power
	- **Present:** Global economic order (multipolar order -> shared power)
		- USA is still robust global economy but not as dominant
		- I.e. China also has power -> can't control each other
	- Note: Tensions between these two powers
		- Try to use military power to bring economic favor (USA)
		- Try to use economic power to bring diplomatic favor (China)
		- Rest of countries try to stop the above (No single power)
	- **Future:** Digital order (not run by governments but by tech companies)
		- I.e. Ukraine war was helped by technology
		- Tech is what governs everything we do + how we learn
		- Competition between digital and physical world 
			- If tied between the two
		- If digital becomes even more dominant
			- Tech will govern everything
			- Techno-polar order
