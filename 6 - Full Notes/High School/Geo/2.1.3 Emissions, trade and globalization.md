# 2.1.3 Emissions, trade and globalization

**Globalization:** the integration of national economies, businesses and trade on a world-wide scale
- **Benefits:** 
	- Opening new markets
	- Reduced cost of goods
	- Improved economic efficiency
	- **Hyper-development:** rapid rate of economic growth
- **Negatives:** 
	- **Enhanced GHE** 
		- **Externalities:** the consequences of economic activities that affect other parties without being reflected in market price
			- I.e. air pollution -> negatively impacts people in surrounding areas but no financial burden
			- Externalities rise as GHGs produced from travel
				- I.e. outsourcing -> saves cost but harms environment with transportation of the goods
		- **Ocean ships:** 4% of fossil fuels/year
			- Shipping -> 4% $CO_2$, 9% $NO_2$, mostly Northern Hemisphere
			- ==No real substitute for fossil fuels for transportation== 
	- **Expanded trade:** When trading is made more readily available by things like liberalization policies (reducing tariffs)
		- Reinforces externalities
			- Reduces importing price -> encourages outsourcing
		- Pollutants are treated as externalities in countries with high manufacturing growth (economy/industry more important)
- **Solutions:** 
	- Carbon caps/trading schemes -> place economic cost on emissions
		- Turn externality into cost of production
		- NO GLOBAL CONSENSUS HOWEVER


**Net importers:** Countries that import more $CO_2$ embedded in goods than they export
- I.e. USA
**Net exporters:** Countries that export more $CO_2$ embedded in goods than they import
- I.e. China
