# 2.1.4 Enhanced greenhouse effect

**Enhanced greenhouse effect:** when the energy balance is disrupted due to human activity
- **Burning of fossil fuels** 
	- GHGs are released when fossil fuels are burned
		- The GHGs trap in radiation and heat
		- Used to vary with [[2.1.3 Forcing agents and feedback cycles|Natural Climate Forcings]] 
			- Now caused by human activity (i.e. fuel, factories, etc.) -> industrial revolution
- **Industry** 
	- Some produce extreme amount of carbon dioxide
		- I.e. cement creation -> 1000kg of cement = 900kg of $CO_2$ 
			- 5% of $CO_2$ 
	- Many produce methane as well
		- From decay of waste (i.e. paper, food, etc.)
- **Agriculture** 
	- Food production produces a lot of GHGs
		- Clearing of land, growing and rearing of food, processing, packaging, transportation and food loss/waste
			- Some have higher carbon footprints (i.e. rice)
			- Meat especially
- **Deforestation** 
	- Trees/plants are essential for carbon cycle
		- Absorb $CO_2$ from atmosphere as carbohydrates -> offsets manmade $CO_2$ production
	- But trees are burned/destroyed
		- Area size of New York lost each day
- **Cooling effect of aerosols** 
	- Aerosols are nasty pollutants
		- But they do cool down the Earth -> because they block the radiations
	- Still trying to remove them -> makes Earth warm even more

***REMEMBER HISTORIC EMISSIONS*** 

**Tasks:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5py2Odi_XAdbiWtP2ExiEcgKTK83zvGWT7BQKdaIzY/edit

**Greenhouse gas emissions ($CO_2$ and $CH_4$**) 
- USA and China are the highest emitters
- Northern hemisphere emits far greater amounts than southern hemisphere (SPATIAL)
	- Bulk of landmass + population + industry is in Northern hemisphere
	- Highest emissions during spring and summer (TEMPORAL)

**Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today (2017)**?
- More than 53% from Asia
- 18% & 17% from NA and Europe
- China is largest emitter
	- 10 billion tons -> 27%
	- Followed by USA -> 15%
	- European union -> 10%
	- India -> 7%
	- Russia -> 5%
- Top 10 are responsible for 75%

**Which countries have emitted the most in total?** 
- US -> 25% total (290 billion tonnes)
- EU -> 22%
- China -> 13%
- India -> 3%
- Africa -> 3%
- SA -> 3%

**Which countries emit the most $CO_2$ per person?** 
- Average -> 5 tonnes of $CO_2$ 
- Qatar -> 49t
- Trinidad -> 30t
- Generally oil producing countries
- Not outliers:
	- Australia -> 17t per year
	- USA & Canada -> 16t
	- Germany -> 10t
	- China -> 7t
- Richest half is responsible for 86%

**Who should take responsibility?** 
- Need low carbon footprint technology to be existent
	- If rich countries of west pursue -> everyone else will follow

**Globalization:** growing interdependence of the world's economies, cultures, and populations
- All causing the GHG problem
- Need to all contribute to solving the problem together
	- Because of problems with transportation, clothing creation, food, etc.
