# 3.3.2 Resource Stewardship Strategies

**Resource stewardship:** Concept that humans can use resources in such a way that they will be available in the future
- (take care so that future generations can survive)
	- Both environmental sustainability and social equity

**4 approaches to resource stewardship:** 
- *Tragedy of the commons*
	- Conflict between individual need and common good -> resources seen as belonging to everyone
	- Global commons refers to areas that lie outside the political reach of any nation
		- I.e. high seas, Antarctica, atmosphere, outer space (cyberspace + poles)
	- I.e. factories have economic benefit but they pollute
	- But, humans can form communal agreements/groups to save ourselves from falling for this tragedy
- *Conservation strategies*
	- **Conservation:** protecting or preserving valuable resources (i.e. minerals, trees, water, wildlife, historical wildlife)
		- **Hard conservation:** preservation of a resource by prohibiting any adverse human impacts on the resource
			- I.e. protecting endangered animals/fragile ecosystems
		- **Soft conservation:** allows resources to be used but no waste
			- I.e. fishing quotas
			- I.e. search for more efficient ways to still use/exploit a resource
				- Bad -> focuses on profits instead of reducing usage
		- **Resource conservation initiatives:** Attempts to conserve resources
			- Much more likely to be started by government/special interest orgs > Not corporations
				- But governments constrained by voting strength + political funding by interested parties (Economic/Political power)
	- **Strategies for petroleum:**
		- High oil cost suggest oil is becoming scarce
			- LIC -> wants oil products
			- HIC -> dependent on oil for economy
			- Provides oil producing countries with power 
				- Encourages a focus on conservation
					- I.e. speed limit in New Zealand (100 to 80)
					- I.e. fuel efficient compact car/hybrids
		- Research into conserving fossil fuels
			- I.e. improve engine and car structure
			- Aerodynamic cars -> use less fuel
			- New types of cars:
				- Solar, electric, orbital, rotary, hybrid
		- Emission control rules
		- Remove lead from exhaust
		- Reasons why oil is still dominant:
			- Improved oil engine
			- More techniques for locating + extracting oil
			- Less waste in extraction and conversion in refining
	- **Strategies for coal:** 
		- Conservation is more focused on making usage more efficient than reducing usage (plentiful + used for electricity)
		- Want to reduce prices (motivation for conservation)
			- I.e. Australia drilling deeper to find oil to prove they have future economic/energy safety
	- **Strategies for forests:** 
		- Exploit other countries' timber
			- I.e. get it from South-East Asia
			- Buy into the forestry industry, take the wood and ship it back to home country
		- There is development into alternatives for house building + furniture
			- But it might just transfer resource pressure (not reduce) -> i.e. fibreglass uses a lot of fossil fuels
		- *Regional saving* 
- *The circular economy*
	- Linear vs circular economy:
		- **Linear**: *Take* resources and *make* product, throw away *waste*
			- Problem: not endless supply of materials + harm from pollution
		- **Circular**: Take, make, over and over
			- Not just recycle, also reuse, fix it, refurbishing, maintain, etc.
			- Possible diagram: 
				- Butterfly diagram
				- One tech cycle, one natural cycle
			- Think of the processes using reusable energy 
			- Still need to limit waste
			- Can maintain quality + cheaper
				- I.e. processing old copper > mining new copper
			- *Note:* You lose some quality every time you recycle/it goes through the process
				- **Downcycling** 
					- But, everything is still food for something else
			- **Substitution:** Use a different material
				- I.e. use sodium ion batteries instead of lithium
			- **Dematerialization:** Use less of a material for the same purpose
				- I.e. only replace certain parts + use recycled parts
			- Instead of owning goods, you can just rent it
				- So that nothing is just wasted + the org is responsible for end of life
				- (Individual ownership -> service)
			- Based on 3 principles:
				- **Eliminate waste and pollution** 
					- Don't let stuff end up in landfills or incinerators
				- **Circulate products and materials (at highest value)** 
					- Keep materials in use (products, components), designed for reuse
				- **Regenerate nature** 
					- Leave more room for natural resources to regrow, etc.
			- [Slides examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jfJR1EZaJUty33V2Ir6fo8pqdANyGhOLopEoIY3ERJM/edit#slide=id.g2d78dc50d1f_5_21) 
		- I.e. Mud jeans
			- You can rent jeans
		- *Is the circular economy scalable beyond business?* 
			- Centres in brazil to repair computers (get people with less education/employment to learn these skills to repair) -> and then people can reuse computers in many public spaces + takes care of ewaste
				- Digital inclusion
- *The sustainable development goals (SDG)*
	- 2015-2030
		- Will be reevaluated in 2030 to see if progress has been made + which goals
	- Was slowed because of pandemic
		- (Waste, less amounts of ways to contribute, etc.)
	- Organize into 3 layers:
		- Environment, society and then economy (layered/dependent on each other)
			- SDG wedding growth -> need to take care of environment before society and that before economy
		- Environment:
			- 14, 13, 6, 15
		- Society:
			- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 16
		- Economy: 8, 9, 10, 12
		- #17 is necessary for all of the goals
	- Resource stewardship related to:
		- 2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15
	- **6 - Clean water & sanitation** 
		- **2 facts and figures**
			- 62% to 75% have clean drinking water (2000-2020)
			- Freshwater is 2.5% of total water on Earth
				- Only 1% is accessible
		- **2 Goal Targets**
			- 6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all
			- 6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
			- 6.4 By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity
		- **Describe and explains the progress being made towards meeting the SDG, highlighting links to 'resource stewardship'.**
			- Access to safe drinking water, sanitation, higher quality water, efficiency of usage, and ecosystem restoration (ie. wetlands) have all been improved
			- It is trying to integrate water management (WEF)
			- It is working with local communities to promote sustainable usage
			- Tech like smart water meters, desalination plants, and advanced water recycling systems

^**Butterfly diagram** 
- Might have to label cycle, etc.
	- Explain how it works/mimics each other
	- Explain the intermediary step
	- **NOTE GOAL: minimize leakages, keep in economy as long as possible**
