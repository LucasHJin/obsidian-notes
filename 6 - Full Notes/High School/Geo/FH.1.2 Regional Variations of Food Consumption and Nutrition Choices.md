# FH.1.2 Regional Variations of Food Consumption and Nutrition Choices

**Disparities in food access:** 
- World is in most productive period:
	- Enough grain alone to feed 3000 calories to everyone
	- Increasing (even per capita)
- In general, HICs have more access than LICs
	- I.e. surpluses in NA and Europe that are dumped rather than sold for a price that doesn't even cover production
	- But also most people starving/malnutrition (especially in LICs)
	- LICs produce less per capita than HICs
		- Farming is **subsistence basis** (consumed by farmer, not much to sell) -> no incentive/means to increase production
		- Traditional farming methods (not optimized) (i.e. no tech)
		- Poor storage facilities -> up to 30% lost to pests
			- I.e. need refrigeration
		- Small divided landholdings when farmer dies and land is divided
			- Equal amounts of varying quality land -> less convenient but some protection against climate crisis
		- **Absentee landlords** -> control land + excessive rent (farmers need to give surplus to pay off debt)
		- Cultivate many crops (for subsistence, but no expert in any crop)
		- **Agribusinesses** -> convincing farmers to abandon food and switch to commercial crops (i.e. cotton, rubber, tobacco) 
	- Food security improved in HICs:
		- New **high yielding varieties (HYV, GMO)** -> shorten growing cycle, enables double cropping (i.e. rice)
			- Also more resistant to disease
		- Widespread irrigation systems
		- Increase in chemical pesticides/fertilizers
			- Improve farm productivity (short term)
		- **Mechanical technology** -> can supplement for people and encourage efficiency

- **Varying reasons:**
	- Cultural/religious ideals/views
	- Geographical location 
		- I.e. in Pakistan -> very rural location where its subsistence farming to feed self (i.e. because of mountainous landscape)
			- Any land -> potatoes
		- Rock salt -> mix in drinks
		- Going from village to village on very small bridges
			- Getting wood, berries, etc. (still good time)
		- Apricot with pasta 
	- Economic status
