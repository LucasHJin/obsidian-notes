# 3.1.2 Measuring Trends in Resource Consumption - Ecological Footprint

**Ecological Footprint:** The theoretical measurement of the amount of land and water a population requires to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb its waste under prevailing technology (measured in **Global Hectares**)
- **Earth Overshoot Day:** Day where we finally consume too many resources (more than the Earth can provide/regenerate within 1 year)
	- Occurs every year
		- Was at the end of the year in 1970s
		- Now its much earlier
	- Can be global but also regional/national
- Currently using equivalent of 1.7 Earths' worth of resources

**Biocapacity:** the capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate an on-going supply of renewable resources and to absorb its spillover wastes
- Unsustainable if ecological footprint > biocapacity

**How to reduce ecological footprint:** 
- Enforcing policies (government)
	- I.e. more public transportation / laws (Hoy no Circula)
	- I.e. combustion of waste
- Not being wasteful (recycling, being conscious of energy/water consumption, etc.)

**Carbon footprint:** The total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions
- Different from ecological footprint
	- (No reference to waste absorption -> only concerned with how much GHG is produced)
