# FH.3.2 The Influence of TNCs in Shaping Food Consumption Habits

**Transnational Corporations (TNCs):** Company operating in at least 2 countries
- Can be based in multiple economic sectors
- Can be from developed and non-developed countries
- Reasons they operate in multiple countries
	- Escape trade tariffs 
	- Want to find the lowest cost for their production (i.e. in LICs, cheaper labor)
	- Reach foreign markets more effectively
	- Exploit resources of foreign countries
		- I.e. Africa -> mineral rich
- **Vertical integration:** Arrangement where the supply chain of a company is owned entirely by the same company
	- I.e. raw materials to finished product
	- Complete control over supplies and stock (reduces overall cost)
		- Economies of scale -> don't owe anybody anything
	- I.e. British petroleum
		- Have refineries, shipping fleet, pipelines, exploitation production rights, 1100 retail stations
- **Horizontal integration:** Company diversifies its operations by expanding through a merger or takeover
	- Done for complementary or competitive reasons
