# Linear correlation explained

**Examples of linear relationships:** 
- Scatter plot
	- Purpose is to find relationships to create **prediction** models
	- Trying to predict $y$, from $x$ 
	- I.e. ![[Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 2.27.14 PM.png|400]] 
	- Can draw a straight line close to many points -> **Linear correlation** 


**Linear correlation:** The relationship between two variables in which the general shape of the scatterplot resembles a straight line (==line of best fit==)
- If upward -> **positive correlation**
- If downward -> **negative correlation**
- If no recognizable pattern (scattered randomly) -> **no correlation**
- If parabola -> **quadratic trend** 
- If exponential -> **exponential trend** 
- *ALWAYS USE A SCATTERPLOT FIRST TO DETERMINE TYPE OF CORRELATION*

**How to estimate line of best fit:**
- Draw a line through the point that is most typical of the data as a whole while still being as close to all other points
	- **Mean point** $(M), (\bar{x},\bar{y})$
		- Found by taking mean of all $x$ coordinates and all $y$ coordinates
- Equation is determined by **least-squares regression**
	- **Least-squares regression:** A method to find the equation of a line for which the square of the vertical distance between the line and each data point is minimised for all data points.

- To analyze reliability of the LOBF (how close one cluster of data compared to another):
