# Measures of central tendency explained

**Central tendency:** A general term for a single value which represents a middle or typical value for a data set.
- Essentially the average
	- Provides a good way of representing entire data set (data is well distributed around the value)

**3 Types:**
- **Mode**: The data value that occurs most frequently in a data set.
	- Similar to [[Presentation of data explained|modal class]] 
	- If grouped in intervals -> estimated as the mid-interval value of the modal class
		- Can have 1+ modes -> bimodal, trimodal, etc.
		- If 0 -> no mode
- **Median** ($m$): The middle value of a data set when the data points are arranged in order of magnitude.
	- If odd ($n+1$):
		- $n/2+1$ term
	- If even ($n$):
		- average of $n/2$ and $n/2+1$ 
	- If grouped in classes -> estimated as the mid-interval of the class containing the middle value
- **Mean** ($\mu$): the sum of the data values divided by the number of data points
	- Just arithmetic mean
	- $\mu =\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}f_i x_i}{n}$
		- Where $f$ is the frequency of $x$ 
		- If grouped in classes -> $x$ is the mid-interval of each class
