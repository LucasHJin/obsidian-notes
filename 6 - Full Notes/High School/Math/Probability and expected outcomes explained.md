# Probability and expected outcomes explained

**Probability:** The likelihood of something happening, given as a ratio, decimal or percentage.
- **Experimental probability:** Probability that is induced (calculating the proportion of the time that an event occurs in an experiment.)
	- Specific to general
- **Theoretical probability:** Probability that is deduced 
	- General to specific
	- $P(A)=\dfrac{\text{number of outcomes in which A occurs}}{\text{total number of outcomes in the sample space}}$ 
- [[How to calculate the probability of an event]] 

**Expected outcomes:** The number of outcomes that are expected over a number of independent trials based on the probability of the outcome occurring once
- Predicting chance of something happening based off of probability
- $nP(A)$
	- Where $n$ is the sample size
