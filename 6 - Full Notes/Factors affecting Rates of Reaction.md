# Factors affecting Rates of Reaction

Controlled by [[R2.2 How fast? The rate of chemical change|collision theory]] 
- Enough energy
- Proper orientation

To note: 
- Temperature = average kinetic energy
	- Not all particles have the same level of energy

---
Can be modelled with [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves]] 

**Temperature**
- Increases average kinetic energy of particles
	- Will increase the amount of particles with sufficient energy
	- Will increase the number of collisions (moving quicker)
		- ==Minor effect compared to 1st==
- $\text{rate of reaction} = \text{collision frequency}\cdot\text{fraction of effective collisions}$ 
- Will typically x2 for every +10 degrees celsius
- For [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves|MB curves]]: 
	- Becomes stretched to the right + lower peak
		- Because more particles will have a higher energy level
		- So more particles will surpass the activation energy

**Concentration** 
- Increasing concentration increases the **number of collisions**
	- Smaller effect than increasing energy
- ==Only works for reaction where reactants are in aqueous solution== 
- Increasing the concentration of the limiting reactant will increase both rate and yield
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-10-26 at 9.06.08 AM.png]] Graph A has limiting reactant's concentration increased
		- This is because there is more of the limiting to react + will still have more collisions
**Pressure** 
- Specifically in gaseous reactions:
	- Will increase concentration and collisions occur more frequency
		- Increase in **frequency of collisions**
**Surface Area** 
- For heterogenous reactions:
	- Reaction only occurs when 2 phases meet and collision between reactant particles occurs
		- I.e. powdering calcium carbonate provides more sites of interaction between the particles
- Increasing surface area increases rate by increasing **frequency of collisions**
**Catalyst:** a substance that changes the rate of a chemical reaction but itself remains unchanged during the reaction
- Provides alternative pathway for the reaction requiring lower **activation energy**
	- Doesn't take part in reaction
	- Written on top of arrow
- I.e. **Enzymes** -> A biological catalyst that speeds up the rate of biochemical reactions.

- Note that $\Delta H$ remains same
- For [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves|MB curves]]: 
	- Shifts the activation energy line to the left
		- Because lowers the activation energy needed for a successful collision
		- Graph remains same shape
