# Procreate layer modes explained

**Normal:**
- Colours are kept at original state
	- Fully opaque and overtop other colours
==**Multiply:**==
- Multiplies the colour of the blending layer with base layer underneath
	- Darker output -> great for shadows (no saturation)
**Darken:**
- Compares the colours between 2 layers
	- Keeps only the darker shades 
**Color burn:**
- Exact opposite of multiply
	- Will boost shadows and darken overall picture
**Linear burn:**
- Combines colour burn and multiply
	- Darker and more saturated colours (not as much as either)
**Darker colour + Lighter colour:**
- Helpful for adding shadows or highlights to flat/cartoon piece
	- Will make colours darker/lighter by 10-20% of base layer
**Lighten:**
- Similar to darken but opposite result
	- Keeps the lighter shades
==**Screen:**==
- Great for highlights 
- Removes blacks in the layer -> only white levels blend
**Color dodge:**
- Lightens colours of the base layer (opposite of colour burn)
	- Mid tones become more saturated
==**Add:**==
- Brightest mode for any highlights
==**Overlay:**==
- Helps paint colourful shadows
	- Not overly saturated
- Lets you paint rich highlights
- Use just pure white/black
**Soft light:**
- Creates very soft tones of shadows (and highlights)
	- Compared to multiply or colour burn
- ==Helpful if you make outlines soft light -> makes them respect same tones as fill to see more easily if you have filled in everything==
**Hard light:**
- Helpful with brighter colours (brightens up areas with a touch of saturation)
	- And shadows
- Good because screen only allows white
**Vivid light:**
- NEVER 100% OPACITY
- Extreme version of overlay + soft light
**Linear light:**
- Combination of linear dodge + linear burn
**Pin light:**
- Base layer is responsible for 2nd layer's transparency
	- Over halfway mark -> receives opacity
	- Under halfway mark -> completely opaque
**Hard mix:**
- Fully posterizes base layer
	- Creates harsh contrasted images
**Difference:**
- For making sure 2 layers are aligned
	- Should be black if same pixels overtop -> otherwise will show colour
**Exclusion:**
- Inverts the colours of an image
	- I.e. use black to invert everything
	- Use a certain colour to invert similar colours to opposite range
**Subtract + Divide:**
-  Opposites of each other
	- Can obscure/brighten up pixels
**Hue, Saturation, Colour, Luminosity:**
- Component blending modes
	- Hue -> applies only hue to the overall layer
	- Saturation -> applies only saturation to the overall layer
	- Colour -> applies both hue and saturation to the overall layer
	- Luminosity -> applies the luminosity of the used colour
