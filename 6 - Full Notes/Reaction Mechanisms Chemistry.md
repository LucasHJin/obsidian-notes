# Reaction Mechanisms Chemistry

**Reaction mechanism:** A sequence of *elementary steps* by which a chemical reaction occurs.
- **Elementary step:** One step in a series of simple reactions that show the progress of a reaction at the molecular level
	- Also called elementary reaction
- Important because reactions only occur when following specific steps
	- I.e. which bonds are broken, transition states are created, etc.
- **Reaction intermediates:** A species within a multi-step reaction mechanism that is produced and consumed before final step
	- Cancelled out if adding the steps together
		- I.e. ![[Screenshot 2024-10-26 at 2.16.21 PM.png|300]] 
- **Note:** Reaction mechanisms are determined based on kinetic and stoich data

**Rate determining step:** The slowest step of a chemical reaction that determines the [[R2.2 How fast? The rate of chemical change|rate]] at which the overall reaction proceeds.

**Transition states vs Intermediates:** 
- Transition states are unstable and will quickly change to products
- Intermediates are stable and don't need to change to products right away

| Transition states                                                                                       | Intermediates                                                                                                    |

| High energy state                                                                                       | Lies between two high energy states                                                                              |
| Have a very short lifetime so are unstable and cannot be isolated                                       | Are stable so can be isolated                                                                                    |
| Every reaction has a transition state                                                                   | Exist only in two or more step reactions                                                                         |
| Some reactant bonds are broken and some product bonds are formed (resemble both products and reactants) | All of the reactant bonds are broken to form the intermediate product (actual ion or molecule you can work with) |
