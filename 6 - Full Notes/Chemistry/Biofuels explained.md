# Biofuels explained

**Biofuel:** Fuels from biological sources (organic molecules that can be combusted)
- Are [[Renewable vs Non-renewable energy explained|renewable]] 
	- Has shorter HC chains -> means that complete combustion is more likely + less carbon dioxide
- Typically found in various plants

**Definitions:**
- **Chlorophyll:** Green pigment found in plants, which absorbs energy from sunlight for photosynthesis.
- **Photochemical:** A chemical reaction involving the absorption or emission of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared radiation.
- **Cellulose:** An insoluble substance that is the main constituent of plant cell walls and vegetable fibres.
- **Polysaccharides:** A major class of biomolecules, composed of long chains of carbohydrate molecules.

**How?** (photosynthesis)
1. The sun's EMG radiation is absorbed by plants and other organisms
	1. Specifically, absorb certain wavelengths of light within their chlorophyll-containing pigments
2. This generates electrons to power photosynthesis
3. Glucose is produced in PS
	1. ![[Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 12.54.41 PM.png|300]] simplified equation
4. Biofuels are produced via the breakdown or decomposition of larger organic molecules into combustible short-chain hydrocarbons
	1. I.e. alkanes, alcohols, glycerol, and ethyl esters
