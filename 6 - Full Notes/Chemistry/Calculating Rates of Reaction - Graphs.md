# Calculating Rates of Reaction - Graphs

Gradient = steepness = how fast the reaction is proceeding
- Counts as a [[Measuring Rates of Reaction - Techniques|measure of RoR]] 

**Instantaneous rate:** The rate of reaction at a particular moment of time.

**Initial rate:** The rate of the reaction at the start, when $t = 0$.
- Important for comparing effect of various [[Factors affecting Rates of Reaction|factors]] on the reaction rates

**Average rate:** The rate of the entire reaction (start to end when no more reaction).
- Useful if proceeds very quickly as well as for determining some factors
