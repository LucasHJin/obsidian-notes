# Heat and Temperature explained

**Temperature:** qualitative measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system (celsius or kelvin)
- System can gain or release energy -> changes temperature of the surroundings

**Heat:** the ==energy== transferred from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature (joules)
- [[R1.1 Measuring enthalpy changes]] 
- **Exothermic reactions:** System -> Surroundings (energy)
	- I.e. Condensation, Freezing, Deposition, Combustion, Neutralisation
- **Endothermic reactions:** Surroundings -> System (energy)
	- I.e. Evaporation/Boiling, Sublimation, Melting, Photosynthesis, Thermal Decomposition


**Chemical Potential Energy**: energy stored in the chemical bonds between particles
- Depends on arrangement and type of bonding
- Can be represented with Energy Profile Diagrams (relative stability of reactants and products based on CPE)
	- [[Energy profile diagram explained]]
- ==Lower CPE = More Stability==
