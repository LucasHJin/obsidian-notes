# Fossil fuels explained

**Fossil fuel:** fuel formed from the ancient remains of living organisms.
- Subdivided based on organism + characteristics

**Types:** 
- **Coal:** Carbon, traces of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and metals.
	- ==Solid room temperature==
- **Crude oil:** Medium to long chain hydrocarbons, traces of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen and metals.
	- ==Liquid room temperature==
- **Natural gas:** Methane, traces of other small hydrocarbons, water and carbon dioxide.
	- ==Gas room temperature== 

| Advantages                   | Disadvantages                                                  |     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Highly exothermic (energy++) | Harmful                                                        |     |
| Easy transport               | [[Renewable vs Non-renewable energy explained\|Non-renewable]] |     |

**Related to [[Greenhouse effect explained|Greenhouse gasses]]** 
- Combustion of FF releases carbon dioxide (depends on type)
	- **Coal:** (mainly carbon)
		- 1 product -> carbon dioxide ==high==
	- **Crude oil:** (mainly hydrocarbon)
		- 2 products -> carbon dioxide ==medium==
	- **Natural gas:** (mainly methane)
		- 2 products (but lower C:H ratio) -> carbon dioxide ==low== 

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Volumes and moles of $CO_2$ + tendency for incomplete combustion:
	- **Coal > Crude oil > Natural gas** 
- Energy per unit mass:
	- **Coal < Crude oil < Natural gas**
