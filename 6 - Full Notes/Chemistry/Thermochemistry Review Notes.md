# Thermochemistry Review Notes

**Heat vs Temperature vs Enthalpy:** 
- **Heat:** ENERGY THAT IS TRANSFERRED (only internal energy based on kinetic energy)
	- Heat energy and thermal energy are synonyms
- **Temperature:** MEASURE OF PARTICLES' KINETIC MOVEMENT (ENERGY MEASUREMENT)
- **Enthalpy:** Measurement of heat energy (energy transferred through heat) (all total energy in the system)

**Endothermic vs Endothermic:** 
- Endothermic:
	- Energy absorption -> less stable
	- Enthalpy is positive ($+\Delta H$)
	- Bond is broken
- Exothermic:
	- Energy release -> more stable
	- Enthalpy is negative ($-\Delta H$)
	- Bond is formed

**Types of reactions:**
- **Exothermic:**
	- **Combustion:** energy change when 1 mole of a substance is burned completely in oxygen under standard conditions
		- With $O_2$ 
		- ==Incomplete Combustion==
			- $CO_2+H_2O_{(l)}$ 
			- $CO+H_2O$ 
			- $C_{(s)}+H_2O$ 
		- FOR CARBON:
			- ${\rm{C}}({\rm{s}}){\rm{ \;+ \;}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}({\rm{g}}) \to {\rm{C}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}({\rm{g}})$ 
			- ${\rm{2C}}({\rm{s}}){\rm{ \;+ \;}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}({\rm{g}}) \to {\rm{2CO}}({\rm{g}})$ 
	- **Formation:** energy change when 1 mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard state
		- Forming a compound from constituent elements
	- **Neutralization:** 
		- Acid + Base
	- **Electron affinity**: The amount of energy released when a neutral atom gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion.
		- Create bond
- **Endothermic**
	- **Atomization**: enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms is formed from an element in its standard state
		- Endothermic
	- **Ionization**: energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms to form one mole of gaseous 1+ ions
		- Endothermic
	- **Lattice:** enthalpy change when 1 mole of solid ionic compound converted to gaseous ions under standard conditions
		- Endothermic

**Born Haber Cycle:**
- $MX_{(s)}=M^+_{(g)}+X^-_{(g)}$ 
	- M is metal (cation), X is nonmetal (anion)

**Entropy:** Disorderedness of the system. Increases with:
- Changes of state where the distance between particles increases
- Increasing the temperature of a system
- Increasing the number of particles
- Increasing the number of moles of a gaseous system
- The volume of a gaseous system increases
- Bigger/more particles = more complicated substates

**Spontaneity:** ability for reaction to proceed without extra energy other than initial energy
- Enthalpy and Entropy affect this

**Formulas:** 
- $Q=mc\Delta T$ 
- $\Delta H=-\frac{Q}{n}$ 
	- $n=cv$, $n=\frac{m}{M}$ 
- $\Delta H=\Sigma(\text{reactant bond enthalpies})-\Sigma(\text{product bond enthalpies})$  ==Rev== 
	- (Bonds broken) - (Bonds created)
- $\Delta H_{net}=\Sigma\Delta H_r$ (sum up all the enthalpy reactions)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKbVB5TQe0g - energy cycles
-  $\Delta H⦵=\Sigma(\Delta H_f⦵\text{products})-\Sigma(\Delta H_f⦵\text{reactants})$  
-  $\Delta H⦵=\Sigma(\Delta H_c⦵\text{reactants})-\Sigma(\Delta H_c⦵\text{products})$ ==Rev== 
- $\Delta S⦵=\Sigma(S⦵ \text{products})-\Sigma(S⦵ \text{reactants})$ 
- $\Delta S_{surroundings}=-\frac{H}{T}$ 
- $\Delta G⦵=\Sigma(\Delta G_f⦵ \text{products})-\Sigma(\Delta G_f⦵ \text{reactants})$ 
- $\Delta G⦵=\Delta H⦵-T\Delta S⦵$ 
	- **Gibbs Free Energy (G):** the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work
		- $-$ -> spontaneous
		- $+$ -> non-spontaneous
		- $0$ -> equilibrium
	- Temperature is Kelvin
- $\Delta H_{lattice}+\Delta H_{f}=\Delta H_{atom}+E+IE+EA$ 
	- Atomization
		- Changing state
	- E = Bond energy
		- 0 if there is no diatomic elements
	- IE = Ionization energy
		- Removal of electron
	- EA = electron affinity
		- Addition of electron
	- Lattice
		- Strength of ionic bond in ionic compound
	- 

**Fossil fuels:** 
- Types
	- Coal
		- Carbon -> high degree of carbon dioxide
		- Least energy
		- Most likely to combust (impurities)
	- Crude oil
		- Longer hydrocarbons -> less carbon dioxide + water
		- Middle energy
		- Middle likely to combust (requires more oxygen)
	- Natural Gas
		- Mostly methane -> lowest carbon dioxide
		- Most energy
		- Least likely to combust (shorter -> less oxygen required)
- Advantages:
	- Abundant + inexpensive
	- Highly exothermic
- Disadvantages:
	- Harm to environment
	- Global warming
	- Non-renewable

**Biofuels:** 
- Fuels obtained by converting the glucose molecules from photosynthesis
- Advantages:
	- Release less CO2 compared to fossil fuels
	- Inexpensive
	- Can be used directly after synthesis – no mining or processing at a refinery as with fossil fuels
- Disadvantages:
	- Uses land suitable for agriculture
	- Combustion still releases CO2 into the atmosphere
