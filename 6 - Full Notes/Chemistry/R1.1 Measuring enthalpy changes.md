# R1.1 Measuring enthalpy changes

**Key Terms:**
- **Atom**: smallest component of an element
- **Molecule**: multiple atoms, held together by chemical bonds (intramolecular forces)
- **Fire**: an event or process that releases energy in the form of heat, sound and light
- **Energy**: the ability to do work or cause a change (measured in Joules)
	- I.e. energy levels that electrons occupy, ionization energy, etc.
	- **3 processes of energy transfer**
		- Conduction: transfer of energy by direct contact
		- Convection: transfer of energy by the movement of fluids
		- Radiation: transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves.
	- **Law of Conservation of Energy**: in a closed system, total amount of energy remains constant
