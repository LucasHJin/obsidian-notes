# Orders of Reaction Chemistry

**Order of reaction:** the sum of the power of concentration of reactants in the [[Rate Expression and Experimental Determination|rate law expression]] 
- Can also be in reference to a specific reactant
	- I.e. Order of reaction with respect to A
- If concentration has no effect on rate -> OOR of that reactant is $0$ 
- Can be examined with either time-concentration or rate-concentration graphs
	- Can only be determined experimentally
	- You cannot deduce anything about the mechanism or order of reaction by looking at the reaction equation
		- (given the equation, you can't determine the order of reaction because there can be multiple)

**Zero order reactions:** Changing the concentration of a reactant A does not affect the rate of reaction

**First order reactions:** When the concentration of a reactant A is raised to the power of 1, it means the concentration is directly proportional to the rate.
- $\text{rate}=k[A]$

**Second order reactions:** When the concentration of A is raised to the power of two. This means doubling the concentration of A increases the rate four times.
- $\text{rate}=k[A]^2$
