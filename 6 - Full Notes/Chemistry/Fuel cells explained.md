# Fuel cells explained

**Fuel cells:** method of creating energy where the electrical energy is derived directly from a chemical reaction without the need for multiple transformations of energy (use chemical energy of fuel efficiently)

	- **Anode**: negative or reducing electrode that releases electrons to the external circuit and oxidizes during and electrochemical reaction (oxidation side)
		- Right side (hydrogen is supplied)
	- **Cathode**: positive or oxidizing electrode that acquires electrons from the external circuit and is reduced during the electrochemical reaction (reduction side)
		- Left side (oxygen is supplied)
	- It is divided into ==2 half reactions== 
		- Electrons start on oxidation side and then flow to the other side to be use through a wire (creates a current)
			- Membrane allows only the H+ to flow through



**Example:** Methane fuel cell:
- ${\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_{\rm{3}}}{\rm{OH(g) + \frac{3}{2}}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{(g)}} \to {\rm{C}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{(g) + }}{{\rm{2H}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{O(g)}} \qquad ∆H = −\text{711 kJ mol}^{-1}$ 
- ==Half reactions: ==
	- ${\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_{\rm{3}}}{\rm{OH(g) + \;}}{{\rm{H}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{O(l)}} \to {\rm{C}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{(g) + 6H}}_{}^{\rm{ + }}{\rm{(aq) + \;6}}{{\rm{e}}^ - }{\rm{}}$ 
		- Loss of electrons
	- ${{\rm} \frac{3}{2} {\rm}}{{\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{(g) + 6H}}_{}^{\rm{ + }}{\rm{(aq) + \;6}}{{\rm{e}}^ - } \to {\rm{3}}{{\rm{H}}_{\rm{2}}}{\rm{O(l)}}$ 
		- Gain of electrons
- Adding the half reactions gives the balanced net equation
	- Fraction coefficients -> make sure that the combustion reaction is written per mole of fuel combusted
