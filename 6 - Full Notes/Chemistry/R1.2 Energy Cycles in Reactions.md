# R1.2 Energy Cycles in Reactions

**Chemical bonds:** Forces that hold together atoms in compounds/molecules (i.e. ionic, covalent, metallic)
- **Breaking bond:** energy is absorbed from surroundings to break it ($+\Delta H$)
	- Endothermic
- **Forming bond:** energy is released into the surroundings ($-\Delta H$)
	- Exothermic
- Often occur in [[Physical vs Chemical reactions explained|chemical reactions]] 
- **Bond enthalpy (H) / Bond dissociation energy (E):** the energy required to break one mole of chemical bonds in the gaseous state (always positive) (kJ/mol)
	- [[Enthalpy explained]]
