# Molecularity explained

**Molecularity (of a reaction):** The number of reactant species taking part in any step in a reaction. (never greater than 3)
- ^For any elementary step
- *For elementary steps:*
	- **Unimolecular step/molecularity of 1:** Reactant step with 1 reactant species
		- I.e. $NH_4NO_2\rightarrow N_2+2H_2O$ 
	- **Bimolecular step/molecularity of 2:** Reactant step with 2 reactant species
		- I.e. $2HI\rightarrow H_2+I_2$ 
	- **Termolecular step/molecularity of 3:** Reactant step with 3 reactant species
		- Very rare because probability of 3 particles colliding together simultaneously with enough energy and orientation is low
