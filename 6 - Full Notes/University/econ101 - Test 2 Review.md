# econ101 - Test 2 Review

*Note:* chapters 5-8, 10

**Key Terms:** 
- *Price elasticity of demand:* % change in quantity demanded / % change in price
	- >1 → elastic (horizontal), <1 → inelastic (vertical at 0)
		- Ie. life saving surgery = *perfectly inelastic*
		- Ie. soft drinks = *perfectly elastic* 
			- Easy to substitute (so if price changes minimally, quantity changes maximally)
	- *NOTE* → calculate percentage change by dividing by midpoint
	- Elasticity is not constant (lower at lower prices because people don’t want even more → have already bought a lot)
	- *Unit elastic demand* → if the elasticity is 1
	- **Determinants of DPE:**
		- ==Ability to find close substitutes== 
	- *Note* → movement along the curve, not shifts of the curve
- *Total revenue:* price x quantity
	- Change depends on relative % changes in price and quantity
		- Elastic demand → higher price = less revenue (can get a lot more consumers by slightly lowering price)
		- Inelastic demand → higher price = more revenue (customers increase slowly by decreasing price)
- *Cross-price elasticty of demand:* % change in quantity demanded / % change in price of ANOTHER good
	- Positive → substitutes
	- Negative → complements
	- Zero → independent
- *Income elasticity of demand:* % change in quantity demanded / % change in income
	- ≥0 → normal good (more wanted with more income)
	- <0 → inferior good (less wanted with more income)
- *Engel curve* → graph showing total household expenditure to share spent on a particular good
	- Necessity → downwards
	- Luxury → upwards
	- *NOTE* → most luxury and necessity goods are normal goods
		- Luxury is just high income elasticity (i.e. changes a lot when income changes)
- *Price elasticity of supply:* % change in quantity supplied / % change in price
	- >1 → price elastic, <1 → price inelastic
	- **Determinant** → how flexible production is
		- If easy to make more by using more inputs without marginal costs → more is produced
- *Tax:* 
	- *Statutory burden* → who is legally responsible for paying the tax to the government
		-  ==STATUORY BURDEN DOES NOT AFFECT ECONOMIC BURDEN / TAX INCIDENCE== 
	- *On buyers* → lowers demand curve by reducing consumers’ marginal benefit
		- *Tax incidence* → who actually bears the burden of a tax (how it’s divided between buyers / sellers)
		- Buyers have to pay the price on the old demand curve for the equilibrium quantity of the new demand curve
		- Sellers get the equilibrium price of the new demand curve
	- *On sellers* → shifts supply curve up (costs more to produce each quantity)
		- Increases marginal cost to sellers
		- Buyers have to pay the new equilibrium’s price, sellers get equilibrium price of old curve
	- *Tax wedge* → triangle formed by point where vertical distance between demand and supply curve = tax size
		- Don’t shift curves when analyzing burden
		- Determines who pays how much (compare to equilibrium)
		- **Supply > demand (price elasticity):**
			- Burden falls on buyers (can’t substitute as easily)
		- **Demand > supply (price elasticity):**
			- Burden falls on sellers (production is inflexible so hard to reallocate inputs to avoid tax → i.e. on dairy)
- *Subsidy* → payment made by government to incentivize consumption of good/service
	- Regardless of who it goes to → both parties benefit
	- Demand curve shifts up
	- *Subsidy incidence* → who gets more benefit (wedge)
- *Price ceiling:* max price sellers can charge, set by gov
	- If below market equilibrium price → binding (can’t reach equilibrium)
	- Creates a shortage (more demand but not enough supply)
- *Price floor:* min price sellers can charge (i.e. for beer)
	- If above market equilibrium price → binding
	- Creates an excess
- *Quota:* maximum quantity regulation of how much can be sold
	- I.e. dairy quota → vertical line
- ==*1st fundamental theorem of welfare economics* → in a completely free and competitive market, market equilibrium will always arrive at the optimal outcome== 
	- 1st best → max efficiency
	- 2nd best → government intervention
		- I.e. if the market isn’t perfectly competitive (**market failures**) or care about equity
	- *Veil of ignorance* → putting aside self-interest, how would you divide economic pie
- *Positive analysis:* what happens when a policy is adopted (fact)
- *Normative analysis:* if a policy should be adopted (how to choose based on goal) (opinion)
	- *Value judgements* → do gains > losses
- *Efficient outcome* → largest possible total economic surplus in economy
	- Make pie as big as possible
	- *Consumer surplus* → ES from buying something (area under demand, above price)
	- *Producer surplus* → ES from selling something (area under price, above supply)
	- *Voluntary exchange* → both need to benefit (or at least not become worse)
		- ES = Marignal benefit - Marginal cost
		- ==Add together the two triangles== 
	- *Efficient production* → quantity of output produced is made at lowest possible cost
		- I.e. all sellers keep producing as long as cost < price
		- Efficient allocation of inputs → can help produce gains from trades
	- *Efficient allocation* → output is allocated to consumers such that everyone gets max surplus
		- More marginal benefit = gets more output
		- I.e. get output as long as benefit > price
	- *Efficient quantity* → largest quantity of output that produces max ES
		- As long as MB > MC
- *Market failure* → when it’s not a perfectly competitive market (equilibrium is inefficient)
	- Market power → barriers to entry
	- Externalities → choices of buyers/sellers affect ES of others
	- Imperfect information → don’t know about exchanges/trades
	- Irrationality → don’t follow rational rule 
	- Government regulation → i.e. tax
		- Can cause / be a solution
- *Deadweight loss* → ES that is lost from market failure
	- Efficient quantity - actual quantity (can be underproduction or overproduction)
	- Size determined by quantity
		- Price only affects distribution of ES
	- How far economic surplus is from efficient outcome
- *Coincidence of wants* → need to both want something from each other (bartering)
- *Absolute advantage* → who can do something with fewer inputs (i.e. time)
	- *Gains from specialization* → what you can gain if each person does what they’re best at
- *Comparative advantage* → who can do something with lower opportunity cost 
	- I.e. might produce less wine absolutely but more per unit of cloth
- *Gains from trade:* benefits from specializing in producing goods for which they have a comparative advantage and then trade with others
	- *Note* → price of trade falls between 2 costs
		- I.e. if A produces 0.1 wine per cloth and be produced 0.5 wine per cloth, the price might be 0.25 wine per cloth
- *Autarky* → no international trade
	- GRAPH → go from extreme of what they’re better at to if they traded all of it for the other thing
- *Centrally planned economy* → government makes all major decisions (not markets)
- *Internal markets* → use of markets to allocate resources within organizations
	- I.e. buying engines from an internal supplier
- *Knowledge problem* → can’t know all factors to divide resources
	- IM can help by using prices as signals → will automatically reach 1st best outcome (specialize at what they are doing)
- *Externality:* side effect of an activity that falls on bystanders whose welfare is not considered in the private decision that led to the activity (not considered)
	- **POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE** 
	- *Note* → price change ≠ externality
		- Reflects consequences of participants (not bystanders) and is not a side effect
		- Causes a redistribution of economic surplus
	- *Marginal external cost:* extra cost imposed on bystanders from producing one more unit of output
		- **Marginal social cost = marginal external cost + marginal private cost** 
	- *Marginal external benefit:* extra benefit for bystanders from buyers buying something
		- **Marginal social benefit = marginal external benefit + marginal private benefit** 
	- *Socially optimal* → most efficient (MSB = MSC) (equilibrium outcome is inefficient)
		- Negative externalities (more SC) → lower quantity 
			- Overproduction
		- Positive externalities (more SB) → higher quantity
			- Underproduction
- *Nonexcludable good* → can’t keep others from enjoying
- *Nonrival good* → others don’t lose benefit from me using it
- ![[Pasted image 20251113212232.png]] 
	- *Free-rider problem* → bystanders who can get positive externalities of other people’s consumption (don’t do work)
		- So → public goods are prone to underproduction
			- The produced quantity is optimal for private but not social (because social people benefit but there aren’t incentives to produce more quantity because free riders don’t pay)
		- I.e. for vaccines, if private < cost < social, then not many people will get vaccines
			- Want immunity without paying → underproduction
	- *Club good* → can be excludable (monopoly)
- **Solutions to externality:** change incentives so that decision makers *internalize* the effect of their choices on bystanders
	- *Private bargaining* → can solve externality problem with private bargaining if costless and property rights are clearly established
		- I.e. no government intervention → just between bystanders and decision maker
		- I.e. stopping music by paying a person, strategic investment, merger
	- *Corrective tax/subsidy* → might produce more/less than socially optimal (give them a tax/subsidy equal to the marginal external cost/benefit) 
	- *Cap and trade* → implement a quota on max quantity produceable
		- Give each person a certain amount of permits, allow trade
	- *Laws/rules/regulations* → force people to follow
		- But can limit competition, private bargaining, and innovation
	- *Government provision* → gov taxes people and then distributes money accordingly
		- Not all goods from gov are public goods
		- Public ≠ should provide
		- Sometimes it’s better if they fund but don’t provide
	- *Assign ownership rights* → so that common resources aren’t overused
		- *Tragedy of the commons* → overuse (owner internalizes externality)
