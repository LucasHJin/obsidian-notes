# econ101 - Midterm Review

**Key terms:** 
- *Cost-benefit*
	- *Economic surplus* → total benefit - total cost
- *Opportunity cost*
	- *Out of pocket cost* → that you pay for with your own money
	- *Sunk cost* → money you already spent and can’t get back (don’t let it influence future decision)
	- *Next best option*
	- *Production possibilities frontier (PPF)* → can be pushed out by productivity
- *Marginal principle* (Dynamic/continuous choice (not discrete))
	- *Marginal decisions* (incremental benefits/costs)
	- *Rational rule* → keep on doing something as long as MB ≥ MC
- *Interdependence principle*
	- Other choices
	- Other decision makers
	- Other markets
	- Dependencies over time
- *Demand curve* 
	- Price is independent + on vertical access
- *Law of demand* (downwards sloping)
- *Ceteris paribus* → holding everything else constant
- *Rational rule for buyers* → buy until the marginal benefit = price (cost)
	- *Diminishing marginal benefit* → less change in benefit between each one
- *Market demand* → average out and scale
- *Market demand curve* 
	- Also downwards sloping
	- *Intensive margin* → change in activity for already participating people
	- *Extensive margin* → change in number of people involved
		- Can have entry/exit of new/old customers
	- *Shifts*:
		- Increase in demand → curve shifts to right (more quantity demanded at each price)
		- Decrease in demand → curve shifts to left (less quantity demanded at each price)
	- *Factors:* 
		- Income (*normal vs inferior goods*)
			- Normal → want more as more income
			- Inferior → want less as more income
		- Preferences
		- Prices of related goods (*complementary vs substitute goods*)
			- Complimentary → goods used together
			- Substitute → goods that replace one another
		- Expectations
		- Congestion / network effects (value depends on people using it)
			- Congestion → more ppl = worse
			- Network effects → more ppl = better
		- Type and number of buyers in market (doesn’t shift individual)
	- ==CHANGE IN QUANTITY DEMANDED → SHIFT ALONG THE INDIVIDUAL CURVE==  
		- If Price changes
	- ==CHANGE IN DEMAND → SHIFT ENTIRE CURVE== 
		- If other factors change
- *Supply curve* (upwards sloping)
	- Movement along the curve → change in price changes quantity supplied (i.e. more existing firms + new firms at higher prices)
- *Law of supply* (upwards sloping)
- *Perfect competition* → all same product, small impact, can enter/exit, perfect information, no switching costs
	- Reason for why suppliers get assigned prices instead of choosing
- *Choosing supply quantity:* 
	- Marginal principle → to sell 1 more litre of gas
	- Cost-benefit → how much is the cost if you don’t sell one more (opportunity cost)
		- I.e. marginal cost → *variable costs* + *fixed costs* 
- *Rational rule for sellers* → sell until the marginal cost = price (can’t gain anything from selling less)
	- *Diminishing marginal product* → less returns 
		- *Input* (i.e. capital, labor, raw materials) (fixed vs variable) → used to produce *output* 
		- As you use more variable input for a fixed input, marginal product of each variable decreases (harder to achieve more quantity of supply → need more input for each unit of output)
	- *Rising input cost* → variable costs increase
	- ==MARGINAL COST CURVE = SUPPLY CURVE== past the average variable cost
		- ![[Pasted image 20251001210554.png]] 
		- Look at horizontal value on graph → when it’s equal to marginal cost
	- $output=\sqrt{labour\cdot capital}$ 
-  *Market supply curve:* 
	- Increase in supply → shifts curve down (for same quantity, less cost)
	- Decrease in supply → shifts curve up (for same quantity, higher cost)
	- Can change supply without price changes
	- *Factors:* 
		- Input prices (increases marginal cost of production → more for each output)
		- Productivity and technology (produce more with same inputs)
		- Prices of related outputs (*substitutes-in-production* vs *complements-in-production*) 
			- Alternative outputs produced using same input
			- Outputs produced together
		- Expectations (i.e. price might rise in the future)
			- More for non-perishable
		- Type and numbers of sellers
			- Change in number → shifts *market* but not *individual* supply curves
	- ==CHANGE IN QUANTITY SUPPLIED → HOW MUCH A SINGLE SELLER SELLS== 
	- ==CHANGE IN SUPPLY → HOW MUCH MARKET SELLS PER PRICE (i.e. left right shifts)== 
- *Elastic curves:* 
	- Small change in price → leads to big change in quantity supplied/demanded
- *High friction/cost of trading:* 
	- Buying + selling requires significant time, effort, financial cot
- *Market economy:* individuals make their own choice about production/consumption
	- I.e. working a job, going to a bazaar, etc.
- *Planned economy:* decisions about production and distribution are centralized in a central power (not in individuals)
- *Market:* setting that brings together buyers and sellers for transactions
	- Not all have prices
- *Equilibrium* → supply and demand are balanced
	- *Equilibrium price* → price where quantity supplied = quantity demanded
	- *Equilibrium quantity* → quantity at the price
		- Amount sold is limited by the lower one based on vertical line (supply vs demand)
	- *Surplus* → supply > demand
		- I.e. gas stations offer gas at lower prices to attract more customers
	- *Shortage* → demand > supply
		- I.e. customers offer to pay more to get it first
	- *Symptoms of non-equilibrium:* 
		- Quickly changing prices
		- Queuing for goods
		- Secondary markets
- *Diamond water paradox* → price is determined at equilibrium, that’s why diamonds > water cost
- *Equilibrium changes:* (Note that it takes time to transition)
	- *Demand ↑:* equilibrium price increases
	- *Demand ↓:* equilibrium price decreases
	- *Supply ↑:* equilibrium price decreases
	- *Supply ↓:* equilibrium price increases
