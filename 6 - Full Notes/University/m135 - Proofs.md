# m135 - Proofs

**Proof:** a series of convincing arguments that leaves no doubt that a given proposition is true
- **Prove/Disprove** → show that a statement is either true or false
- At the end of a proof → put $Q.E.D$ or a tombstone $\square$ to end it off

**Proposition:** a mathematical claim posed in the form of a statement that either needs
to be proven true or demonstrated false by a valid argument
- **Theorem:** an important proposition
- **Lemma:** a subsidiary proposition (helper proposition used to prove a theorem)
- **Corollary:** a proposition that follows (is given) from a theorem

**What you can use in proofs:** 
- Known facts about elements in a given domain
- Previously proved results
- Hypothesis (for implications)
- Definition → explains what exactly somethign is
	- I.e. even integer is defined as $2k+1, k\in \mathbb Z$ 
	- *Note:* If == [[m135 - If and Only If|If and only if]] in definitions

**Direct proofs + proofs by counter example:** 
- [[m135 - Proving Universally Quantified Statements]] 
- [[m135 - Proving Existentially Quantified Statements]] 
- [[m135 - Proving Implications]] 
- [[m135 - Divisibility of Integers]] 
- *Common pitfalls:* 
	- Can’t choose the same $k$ value for different variables dividing a common variable
	- Don’t assume the conclusion (only hypothesis) 

**Other proofs:** 
- [[m135 - Proof by Contrapositive]] 
- [[m135 - Proof by Contradiction]] 
- [[m135 - Proving Uniqueness]] 
- [[m135 - Proving If and Only If Statements]] 
- [[m135 - Induction]]
