# m135 - Proving Uniqueness

**Uniqueness statement:** variant of the [[m135 - Quantifiers|existential quantifier]] → asserts existence of precisely $1$ element instead of at least 1

**Proof methods:** to prove that “there is a **unique** element $x\in S$ such that $P(x)$ is true”
1. First prove the existentially quantified statement “there exists at least one element $x\in S$ such that $P(x)$ is true” (**EXISTENCE**)
2. Then, you have 2 options: (**UNIQUENESS**)
	1. Assume $P(x)$ and $P(y)$ are true for $x, y\in S$ and prove $x=y$ 
	2. Assume $P(x)$ and $P(y)$ are true for distinct $x, y\in S$ and prove that this leads to a contradiction
