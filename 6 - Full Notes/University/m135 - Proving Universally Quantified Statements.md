# m135 - Proving Universally Quantified Statements

*NOTE:* When proving an identity, don’t start by assuming the truth of the identity.
- Might not always be prove → determine if true/false and then prove/disprove

**Direct proof:** directly proving the open sentence
- Choose a representative element (variable) $x$ of the set $S$ 
	- No specific number
- Using only known properties of values of $S$, prove the statement $P(x)$ to be true
- *Example:* 
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 10.22.24 PM.png]]
- **Case analysis:** where you prove the UQS for different parts of the domain separately
	- I.e. “For every integer $k$, prove that $k(k-1)\geq 0$” 
		- Cases → $k\leq -1$, $k=0, 1$, $k\geq 2$ 
- *Note:* For a lot of the inequalities → just start with something you know is true and then manipulate by adding/multiplying to the inequality

**Proof by counter example:** proving by showing it doesn’t work
- I.e. for a UQS $\forall x\in S, P(x)$ → find an element $x\in S$ for which the open sentence $P(x)$ is false
