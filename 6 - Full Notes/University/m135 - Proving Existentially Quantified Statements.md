# m135 - Proving Existentially Quantified Statements

**In general**:
- To prove EQS “$\exists x\in S, P(x)$” → provide an explicit value $x$ in $S$ and show that $P$ is true for this value

**Trial and Error:** good for small limited domains where you can try each value
- In general, it’s bad → better to be more methodical

**Narrowed search:** transform given equations to find solutions to them (i.e. factor)
- This may produce **extraneous solutions** → solutions that appear but don’t satisfy original equation
	- Can check by re-substituting
	- Can check if each step is invertible

**Relating to [[m135 - Proving Universally Quantified Statements|UQS]]** → can also need to prove a pair of nested quantifier statements

**Disproving EQS:** 
- To disprove $\exists x\in S, P(x)$ → prove $\forall x\in S, \neg P(x)$ 
	- Prove that for all $x$ in $S$, $P(x)$ is false
