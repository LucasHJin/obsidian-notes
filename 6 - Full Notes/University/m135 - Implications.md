# m135 - Implications

**Implication:** statement where some component implies some other [[m135 - Conjunction and Disjunction|component]] 
- $A\implies B$ (A implies B)
	- $A$ → hypothesis
	- $B$ → conclusion
- For an implication to be true → truthiness of hypothesis must be accompanied by that of the conclusion
	- Only false when $A$ is true and $B$ is false
		- Can still be true if $A$ is true but $B$ is false (**vacuously true**) 
			- → i.e. if I am the King of Canada, then 2+2=4 (can still be true)
- *Note:* Viewed as a timeline starting at A then leading logically to B
	- I.e. If $A$ (is true), then $B$ (must be true)
