# econ101 - Final Review

*Note:*
- Previous: [[econ101 - Test 1 Review]] [[econ101 - Test 2 Review]] 
- Chapters 14, 15, 16

**Key Terms:** 
- **Industrial organization:** how businesses are organized in markets + how their structure affects competitiveness
	- **Market structure:** helps determine how much market power a seller has (can they change price without losing sales?)
	- Ex perfectly competitive → no market power
- **Monopoly:** market with one seller (infinite market power)
	- Opposite of *perfectly competitive* 
		- Many sellers, same products
	- **Imperfect competitive** → in between the two extremes
		- **Oligopoly:** small number of big sellers (with relatively big market power)
			- I.e. internet provider
		- **Monopolistic competition:** many competing businesses but slightly different products
			- **Product differentiation:** increase market power by giving a reason other than price to choose your product
- **Firm’s demand curve:** relates buyer quantity demanded and price charged by business
	- *Perfectly competitive* → infinitely elastic demand curve (flat line)
	- *Monopolist* → same as market demand curve
		- Because they are the only selling the product (still lose quantity when increase price though)
	- More market power = closer it mirrors the market demand curve
		- Can raise price without losing customers
		- Market power → less price elastic (steeper)
	- *Note* → still represents how much buyers want
		- How much they want at that one price (not whole market)
- **Firm’s marginal revenue curve:** 
	- **Marginal revenue:** addition to its total revenue from selling one more unit of output
		- Output effect of price change - discount effect of price change
		- I.e. to sell a third car, you must first lower the price (but then you lose money on the first 2 sales as well)
		- $P-\Delta PQ$ or $\Delta TR/\Delta Q$ 
	- **Inframarginal:** what you sell before reaching the margin
	- *Note* → marginal revenue of an increase in quantity is always less than the price
	- **Discount effect:** how much you lose from the demand curve to get revenue curve
		- Increases with more units (more affected)
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 9.13.14 PM.png|400]] 
- **Rational rule for sellers:** sell one more unit if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost
	- Go up to find price at the point on the demand curve
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 9.19.32 PM.png|400]] 
		- A is if based on RRFS, B is if based on perfect outcome
	- **Consequences of market power:** 
		- Price in an imperfect competitive market > perfectly competitive market
			- Profit / Q = Price - Total Cost / Q
		- Quantity in imperfect comp market is lower
		- Firm with market power earns profit margin = price - average cost
		- **Profit margin:** business with MP can survive even with inefficient high cost
- **Competition policy:** laws to ensure markets remain competitive (i.e. better for the buyers)
	- Anti collusion laws
	- Merger laws → can’t just consolidate market power
	- Exclusionary practices + Predatory pricing (to screw over other sellers)
- **Policies to mitigate harm from MP:** 
	- Price ceilings → less market power for monopolies
		- Equal to marginal cost of production
	- Public provision (gov takes care of it)
		- **Natural monopoly** → high fixed cost of operation means only 1 business services the market (can’t easily change or else forced out of business)
- **Accounting profit:** total revenue from sales - explicit financial costs (i.e. input costs)
- **Economic profit:** total revenue - (explicit financial costs + implicit opportunity costs)
	- I.e. you could have used the invested money in something else
	- Profit margin x number of units sold
- **Average revenue:** revenue per unit supplied
	- ==Equal to the price if the business charged the same price for everyone== 
- **Average total cost:
	- Average total cost = Variable cost/Q + fixed cost/Q
		- AFC → falls with increased output (same cost for more output)
		- AVC → increases with more output
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 1.30.58 AM.png|400]] 
- **Profit margin:** average revenue (price) - average cost
	- When firm demand curve > average cost
- **Short run horizon:** time period where there’s a fixed set of competitors with given production capacities
	- Only need to outcompete existing rivals
- **Long run horizon:** time period where new competitors can enter/expand market + can contract/exit market
	- Need to adjust production capacity
- **Rational rule for entry:** enter market if expected economic profits are positive (price > AC)
	- **Effect on firm demand curve:** 
		- Decreased demand + less market power
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 1.34.59 AM.png|300]] 
			- Shifts left + more elastic
		- Will drive down economic profit until it reaches 0
			- *Note* → not in debt, just no advantage in this situation compared to anything else (because EC includes implicit costs)
- **Rational rule for exit:** exit market if expected economic profits are negative (price < AC)
	- **Effect on firm demand curve:** 
		- More demand + more market power
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 1.37.59 AM.png|300]] 
			- Shifts right + less elastic
		- Sellers will leave while negative profits until economic profits are zero (Price = Average cost)
			- No longer unprofitable
- *Note:* perfect competition always drives price down to marginal cost
	- Marginal cost = average cost = FDC at minimum 
- *Note:* price equals average cost
	- In the long run with ==no barriers to entry== → price will eventuall equal average cost because companies will join and leave
- **Barriers to entry:** obstacles that make it difficult for new firms to enter a market
	- *Customer lock in* → make it hard for customers to switch + create customer loyalty
		- Network effect → useful because many ppl use it
	- *Cost advantages* → investments into mass production, R&D, etc. allows them to produce at cheaper prices (lower average cost curve)
		- **Monopsony power:** bigger firms have more market power in input markets
	- *Government policy* → persuade politicians to impose costs for starting a new business
		- I.e. license, registration, etc.
	- *Entry deterrence* → invest in future assets (i..e excess production or extra cash to be able to lower marginal cost quickly)
		- Or saturate market
- **One price outcome:** if businesses have market power, they can ration supply and raise price above marginal cost
	- This captures part of consumer surplus (but also creates deadweight loss)
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 2.09.04 AM.png|400]] 
- **Price discrimination:** selling same good at different price (charge at each consumer’s reservation price)
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 2.10.31 AM.png|400]] 
	- **Reservation price:** max price a customer is willing to pay for a product
		- Equal to their marginal benefit
	- *Cost* → consumer welfare
- **Targetting prices:** 
	- *Group pricing* → use general characteristics of consumers to decide price
		- I.e. race, age, etc.
	- *Hurdle method* → offer lower prices in exchange for additional hurdles/obstacles
		- I.e. discount racks at clothing store, deals at lunch, etc.

*Note:* 
- **Different types of demand curves:** 
	- Individual demand curve → how much an individual is willing to buy at each price
	- Market demand curve → how much entire market is willing to buy at each price
	- Firm demand curve → how much buyers are willing to buy from a specific firm at each price
		- Depends on if they have market power
