# m135 - Subsets

Related to [[m135 - Set Operations|set operations]] 

**Disjoint:** two sets $S$ and $T$ are disjoint when they have no elements in common
- $S\cap T=\emptyset$ 
- Note:
	- $S$ and $\emptyset$ are disjoint for all sets $S$ 
	- $S$ and $\overline{S}$ are disjoint for all sets $S$ 

**Subset:** a set $S$ is a subset of set $T$ if every element of $S$ belongs to $T$ (also exists in $T$)
- Written as $S\subseteq T$ → $T$ is a **superset** of $S$
- **Proper subset:** when $S$ is a subset of $T$ and there is an element in $T$ not in $S$ (the sets aren’t the exact same)
	- Written as $S\subset T$ or $S\not\subset T$ or $S\subsetneq T$ 
	- $T$ is a **proper superset** of $S$ 
	- If it is a proper subset → it is also guaranteed to be a subset
- **Not a subset:** when there exists a value in $S$ not in $T$ 
	- Written as $S\not\subseteq T$
