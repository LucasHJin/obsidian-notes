# m135 - Proof by Contradiction

**Proof by contradiction:** For a statement $A$, either $A$ or $\neg A$ must be false
- **Contradiction:** “$A\land \neg A$ is true” (because it is always false)
- So, you just need to show that for a statement/implication two contradicting things must both be true which means it must be false
- Oftentimes:
	- $\neg (A\implies B)\equiv (A\land (\neg B))$ 

*Note:* very similar to [[m135 - Proof by Contrapositive]] 
- Assume $A\land \neg B$ to deduce $A$ is false is very similar to prove $\neg B\implies \neg A$
