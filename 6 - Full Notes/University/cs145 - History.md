Final exam:
- Will be a multiple choice question/simple question
- Have a general idea about great people + key ideas
	- Not dates or anything specific

**Important people/ideas:** 
- Charles Babbage
	- Speculative mechanical computers
- Ada Augusta Byron
	- Wrote about operation of analytical engines
- David Hilbert
	- Is math complete, consistent and decideable?
- Kurt Godel
	- Incompleteness theorem
- Alonzo Church
	- Created lambda calculus
		- Model of computation to define what computation is
	- No to the last question
- Alan Turing
	- Turing machine → different model of computation (compared to lambda calc)
		- Get symbol, list direction (makes up an action)
- John von Neumann
	- Architecture for creating a computer + storing data
- John Backus
	- FORTRAN → used for math + science programming
	- Backus–Naur form
	- Criticized lambda calculus
- Grace Murray Hopper
	- Wrote first compiler + made programs more readable
- John McCarthy
	- Lisp → wanted recursion
		- Lisp to Scheme to Racket
- Imperative → storage + data manipulation
- Functional → computing using applications of functions
