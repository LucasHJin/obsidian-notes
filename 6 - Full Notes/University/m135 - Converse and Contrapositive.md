# m135 - Converse and Contrapositive

Both relate to a variation of an implication
- **Converse:** the reverse of another implication
	- I.e. $B\implies A$ is converse of $A\implies B$ 
	- ==NOT logically equivalent== 
- **Contrapositive:** the [[m135 - Statements|negation]] of another implication
	- I.e. $\neg B\implies \neg A$ is the implication of $A\implies B$ 
	- ==IS logically equivalent== 

*Note:* Implications are also equal to another type of compound statement
- $A\implies B\equiv (\neg A)\vee B$ 
	- If A then B is the same as not A or B
- $\neg(A\implies B)\equiv A\land (\neg B)$
