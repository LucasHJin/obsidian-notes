# m135 - Divisibility of Integers

**Division:** $m|n$ (m divides n) if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=km$ 
- $m$ → **divisor/factor** of $n$ 
- $n$ → **multiple** of $m$ 
- $m\nmid n$ → not divisible
- *NOTE:* $0|0$ is true

**General laws:** 
- **Transitivity of Divisibility (TD):** For integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a|b$ and $b|c$ then $a|c$.
- **Divisibility of Integer Combinations (DIC):** For all integers $a, b$ and $c$, if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then for all integers $x$ and $y$, $a|(bx+cy)$.
	- For DIC problems → if you’re given multiple divisiblity rules, you can use them along with any values $x, y$ based on DIC and then [[m135 - Proving Implications|substitute]] in from there
- For all integers $a, b$ and $c$, if $a|b$ or $a|c$ then $a|bc$.
	- Provable using [[m135 - Implications|a law for implications]] + cases
	- In this case → don’t repeat the proof because it is very similar
		- Can just say “The proof that if $a|c$, then $a|bc$ is similar and so it is omitted.”
