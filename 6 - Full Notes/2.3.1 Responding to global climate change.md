# 2.3.1 Responding to global climate change

**Consequences + Adaptations of climate change:**
- Compromises many resources and cities near the sea
	- Front line of climate change
	- Directly exposed to non climate coastal
- Exposure + sensitivity
	- I.e. creating a still house to avoid being affected by flooding
	- Use a bank account instead of money
		- Be more technologically advanced
	- 3.3-3.6 billion people are affected in hotspots
- There is a tipping point (for temp)
	- Irreversible change 
- Africa is most vulnerable
- **Maladaptation:** when you try to help but end up causing more harm
	- I.e. sea wall destroying the environment

**How to address climate change:**
- Impact of climate change is worsened by destruction of habitats
- Nature based + engineering approaches
- Social safety net

**Risk:** the potential that the variables associated with climate change will reach such extreme levels that they have an adverse impact on human life (i.e. storms, flooding, drought) 
- often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events (likelihood) or trends multiplied by the impacts (or consequences) if these events or trends occur. 
- results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard 

**Vulnerability:** the sensitivity and susceptibility to the adverse effects of climate change and the ability (or otherwise) to cope with them
- Often central hemisphere (AFRICA) 

**Disparities based on location:** 
- Most at risk in lower hemisphere (central hemisphere specifically) 
- Central African Republic most at risk (0.01)
- Denmark least at risk (10.00)

**Disparities based on wealth:** 
- CC makes poverty worse
- Could push 130 million people into poverty in the next 10 years
- Already worse affected:
	- Extreme heat -> streets in poor areas were 3-10C hotter
		- Need to take medication to cope with the increased heat
		- Impossible to stand it (too much concrete, lack of trees)
- People get displaced
	- I.e. when richer people move there or from disasters
	- No infrastructure to absorb other people
		- Creates deforestation -> more CC
- Poor live in worse conditions
	- Less prepared
	- 2x as many disasters (HIC), 3x as many disasters (LIC)
		- Compared to grandparents
- Less vegetation = increases death chance by 5%
	- South Africa is planning on planting 1 million trees in the city
- Unable to deal with rising food prices
- Live in more disaster-prone areas
- Less medical care (more susceptible to diseases)

**Disparities based on social difference:** 
- 80% of people displaced by climate change are women
	- Because primary caregivers and providers of food
	- More likely to experience poverty + less socioeconomic power (less likely to have income) (no say in community politics)
		- Less likely to recover from disasters + disasters occur more often in poorer places
		- Increased danger against women after disasters
			- No law to protect them
	- Men have better treatment in LICs
		- I.e. more likely to know how to swim
	- Many single mothers
		- I.e. New Orleans
- I.e. Lake Chad -> nomadic women need to walk much farther for water
	- Working harder to feed families without support
	- +carrying fire/fuel wood
- I.e. Bangladesh - Cyclone Gorki -> 9 times more woman killed
- Possibilities:
	- Involve women in policy making decisions relating to climate change
		- I.e. IPCC -> 25%
	- Paris agreement
		- Do it with gender responsive approach
	- Fair representation
		- Women pollute less -> eat less meat + drive less
- For elderly:
	- Less likely to have financial resources
	- Harder to cope with extreme conditions/diseases
	-
